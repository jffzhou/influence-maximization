Hi all! I previously was using Great Lakes and they have transferred my student loans to Nelnet. Because of this my credit has taken a 30+ point hit even though the amount I owe has not changed. I believe it was because of how long I had my loans in Great Lakes. Is there anyway to mitigate this credit hit?;13i93wz;6wfu6ut7;
This exact thing happened to me about 10 years ago.  Mu credit also took a hit.  After a couple of months things will go back to normal.  Credit scores are wacky.;jk92owj;pe0hct3;6wfu6ut7
Following. I'm in the exact same boat as you Greater Lakes to Nelnet. My credit took a 25pt hit. Thanks for asking this question.;jk8n4li;pevq601;6wfu6ut7
">I believe it was because of how long I had my loans in Great Lakes.FICO scores open and closed accounts the same.  Closed accounts in good standing will remain on your report for up to ten years and be included in your FICO score.So that would not be it unless you are talking about Credit Karma's useless proprietary score.It's common for there to be a ""wobble"" in your FICO score when a large loan is paid.   Never seen a good explanation why (possibly credit mix change) but it usually bounces back within a few months.";jk8pddh;t6qw4oky;6wfu6ut7
Mine started with nelnet then went to great lakes and now back to nelnet. I'm so confused;jk8p1pb;bl3ifzfb;6wfu6ut7
This happened to me about a month ago when Great Lakes was transferring to Nelnet. Your loans from Nelnet might not be on your credit report yet just the closed accounts from the previous party who held them. As soon as my loans from Nelnet showed up on my report my credit score went right back up to where it was. You just have to wait for the transfer to fully show up on your report.;jk9log1;k42zgvui;6wfu6ut7
Same issue. Credit karma showed me taking a 30 point hit with trans union and the it came back up today. It affected my credit history but now I have 25 accounts open vs the 8 I originally had.;jk8w89z;j0glz;6wfu6ut7
Damn I guess I should check my credit score now too since I received that same email recently;jk96xbg;3bmldfqq;6wfu6ut7
Just checked and mine also took a large hit and I’m guessing it’s for a similar reason Great Lakes to nelnet. I wasn’t planning on making a major purchase anytime soon with credit so it doesn’t really affect me but here’s another data point.;jk954cz;12qlok;6wfu6ut7
How long ago did this occur?  This is a known issue in credit reporting when the servicing transfer doesn't use the right code.  The good news is it usually resolves itself on the second reporting cycle so roughly 30 days.;jk9jv54;11cjun;6wfu6ut7
Interesting… I wouldn’t have expected this but it’s apparently commonhttps://www.creditkarma.com/advice/i/lender-name-change-affect-credit-reports;jk8p0ug;lstvn72e;6wfu6ut7
"Same thing happened to me. Except the loan amount isn't showing up on my credit report anywhere yet. So i took a hit from the credit age dropping but didn't go up from ""not""  having student loans. FICO is a backwards system that rewards consumers for borrowing money and taking on debt. Luckily I don't plan on applying for credit anytime soon so the decrease shouldn't be an issue but it's confusing and a little demoralizing after working so hard to get my score up.";jk9y2ov;7h9mw1y7;6wfu6ut7
Vantage score took a hit.  Vantage score doesn't matter.  How does your FICO8 look?  You checking your score by Credit Karma or some other rather useless app that uses their own score that doesn't have much connection to your actual score?  The number of posts that are freak-outs over interpreting Credit Karma reported scores as real scores is like a constant flood on this subreddit.  I wish there was a way to like have a stickypost explaining that Vantage is not FICO.;jk8u7wy;54d01sls;6wfu6ut7
So mine were transferred as well but I *didnt* get the credit hit that was expecting. I have no idea why;jk9pmcm;3o3f23xf;6wfu6ut7
Oof I feel lucky my score only dropped single digits. My grad and undergrad loans were both with Great Lakes (I was around $30k in debt). My loans were my oldest line of credit August 2012. I’m also annoyed because I have to redo student debt repayment with work because of this. My job pays $100 a month on my loans and now I’ve missed the April and May payment on it because of the Great Lakes-Nelnet change. Ugh I’m sorry other people are going through this too.;jkaxzsn;4khe4wg;6wfu6ut7
Yes exactly same!! I was trying to buy a house and it messed up my numbers in the process.;jk9q0mb;5361l6l9;6wfu6ut7
It could be that the credit agencies are seeing the loans at two places at the same time. This might happen for a while until the account gets reconciled & Great Lakes shows a zero balance. Just speculating. Happens when I pre-auth credit cards and run the sale amount once order ships. Customer sees pending (pre-auth) and a sale amount so they assume we charged 2x. Takes bank 48 hours or more before pre-auth drops off despite a digital token being passed back and forth to the bank. Maybe the bank is sitting on the float.;jk9qbrj;2gcuvbdb;6wfu6ut7
Somewhat related did anyone with loans transferring from GL to Nelnet have their autopay info populate on Nelnet?  I don't know if they are waiting for repayment to start before showing this info or if my auto pay info didn't make it over for whatever reason.  Worst case is wait and see once payments resume... just curious.;jk9y89h;c9jya;6wfu6ut7
Same thing happened to me over 40 points! Credit Karma tells me it's because the average age of my loans got split in half after Nelnet split my one BIG loan from Greatlakes into 8 individual loans 😭;jkabt9a;r4n8m;6wfu6ut7
I got a mortgage in January and the loan officer found that my loans were double reporting both the old and new servicer. He kept asking me about additional loans I had and eventually put two and two together and got the duplicates removed from my credit report.;jkae3y4;di16t;6wfu6ut7
All my student loans were forgiven due to total disability over 12 years ago. All of a sudden with the shuffling of loans they've found loans that were missed the first time around. They were added to my credit report when they were never there in the first place. Now I have loans I don't even owe on my credit report. It was a 45 point hit for me. I've tried handling the issue but they tell me they have no idea how long it will take for them to clear out the loans. They also said not to make payments because I'll never get the money back. Crossing my fingers they take care of the clerical error before they start asking me to make payments on the loans.;jkavrlg;7ocykucst;6wfu6ut7
The same thing happened to me I think it has something to do with the fact that Great Lakes reported my loan as one big loan whereas Nelnet reports each distribution as its own loan. I took like 15 distributions and only recently started paying my loans and payments get applied to the distribution with the highest interest rate first so my report shows I have 14 loans that are still at the same balance they were 1-4 years ago.;jk8pz1t;62338;6wfu6ut7
Same. Mine got paid off (still have the screenshot) and I took a 30+ hit. Then they put the loan back and transferred it so I still owe but never got my credit points back;jk99wmj;lq8jk;6wfu6ut7
This must have been why my credit score fico dropped on Wells Fargo app. I went from 794 - > 775. My federal student loan provider was OSLA and is now changing to Aidvantage. I did have my credit utility go up this month which I thought was the cause. My credit amongst all my cards is 47K and my utility is usually 1-3% of that. Thought it was because this month was 10% due to a large purchase I did (though I paid it off immediately in full);jk9cfvm;a23h93a8;6wfu6ut7
Interesting. My Great Lakes closed out today and it only dropped mine by 5 pts. I don’t see Nelnet added yet so maybe will see the big drop soon.;jk9ha8r;kmeqfqe9;6wfu6ut7
I'm in the same boat with Great Lakes/Nelnet but on my report the year opened did not change. I wonder if you can contact the credit agencies to make sure the date opened reflects the date the loans were taken vs the date Nelnet took over;jk9ktvy;zwsu3;6wfu6ut7
Great Lakes was acquired by NelNet a while ago. This is just the name being moved.;jk9n6r0;10z055;6wfu6ut7
My score drop because great lake reported the amount as one lump sum and the age of the credit was from time i took the loan and Nelnet report the loans separately so it messed up the credit age;jk9nsei;dejbqlgb;6wfu6ut7
mine bounced back to normal after a few months. sucks but there’s nothing you can do;jk9t5l5;k4g660tn;6wfu6ut7
Don't know a solution but the same thing happened to me when our mortgage was sold score bounced back in 3-4 months though. It seemed to be the account closing that knocked the score down.;jk9v8rl;8tvsi;6wfu6ut7
Oh no 😭 I just had my loans transferred from Great Lakes. Brb while I log into credit karma;jka0wgb;7qf8o5rz;6wfu6ut7
Same. Great Lakes to Nelnet. Haven’t checked my FICO score but if it was hit it won’t matter much unless you’re trying to buy a car right now;jka581c;capnc;6wfu6ut7
Omg I just checked my credit score and it dropped by 50pts?! 😤. I think it's how they reported the student loans. They report it as an individual loan account instead of total amount. This is very upsetting.;jkag1ry;2e8abbsk;6wfu6ut7
Mine too. I hit 700 credit score for the first time in my life like a week ago. :( very sad;jkaj1o6;13lxir;6wfu6ut7
Unless you plan on taking out a loan on anything coming up I wouldn’t worry about your score. It will climb back soon enough.;jkaln4p;p732d;6wfu6ut7
Happened to me. Went down 25pts then once it showed back up my credit went up 35pts..;jkals33;rvams;6wfu6ut7
When mine transferred over from Great Lakes to nelnet in March it raised my credit score +6 points to 743. I thought it would lower since Great Lakes was my longest creditor. Nelnet is on my credit report now with the same credit age as it was with Great Lakes.I imagine that’s how it should be. You may call nelnet and see if they can do anything on their end. I’ve called them once since the switch and they were like SUPER helpful!;jkamv2v;jkyqw451;6wfu6ut7
Fwiw Nelnet merged with Great Lakes - years ago. I’m guessing this change was because loan service contracts were just changed by the Feds.;jkanguq;wc6jz;6wfu6ut7
Dispute the inquiry with the credit bureaus and it will most likely fall off in 45-60 days.;jkarjr0;c5tw6;6wfu6ut7
Same it also broke the total balance into like dozens of installments;jkaw170;17is2z;6wfu6ut7
My mortgage got sold and I took a 30 point hit. It went back after a few months.;jkazio9;esl63;6wfu6ut7
It's a combination of things:* It sees your great lakes loans as paid off so a lower credit utilization (which normally isn't bad but I'm assuming it's a bigger amount.* With Nelnet counting as a new loan it drastically lowered the age of your credit. I wouldn't worry too much about it - it should be back up to it's original amount in a few months. Mine took a 35 point hit (luckily I'm still listed in the exceptional range but right on the line now instead of firmly in it) but it's already gone back up 7 points. Credit scores are weird. Look at them the same way you would with sticks - day to day doesn't matter. Just the overall trend.;jkb3mu1;li7n8l1d;6wfu6ut7
It’ll correct as others have said. What baffles me is that something similar happened when my loan got moved to aidvantage and it has zero affect on my score;jkb3sek;pjbdk;6wfu6ut7
"Saving this because I am in the same boat as you. Greatlakes to NelNet. My credit has not taken a hit yet though  but now I'm nervous after reading all these comments. What makes me even more nervous is they initially sent an email saying that they have me on record as ""currently in bankruptcy"" and then 12 hours later sent me an apology email saying disregard that their records show I'm not in bankruptcy and that they ""know first impressions matter and this is not the kind of first impression we want to make. We sincerely aplogize for the alarm this may have caused you."" Thankfully I hadn't read their emails yet because I definitely would have thought wtf.So I'm hoping this is another mistake for the people who have taken a credit hit because I've been working hard on my credit the last few years and would suck to see it go down lol";jkb4vs1;bksf7;6wfu6ut7
Why are you micromanaging your credit score ? Just pay your bills on time and ignore the fluctuations. No reason to be concerned about a minor drop unless you in the process of getting a loan for something.;jkb5qy4;12tdywgd;6wfu6ut7
What you see isn't the same numbers that any company will see when you need to use your credit score. Don't sweat 30 points.;jkblwdf;8uznire5;6wfu6ut7
My students went from Great Lakes to Nelnet but I haven't seen a change in my credit score yet. Unless you're buying a house or another large purchase you need to finance don't worry about your credit score. Pay off debt and build your savings.;jkc6ytw;eiyg6;6wfu6ut7
Absolutely bonkers that this is just considered normal.  Credit scores predatory interest lifelong debt that follows you even if you declare bankruptcy.  It’s absurd.;jkcibpe;3kb3b;6wfu6ut7
Nelnet is hell on earth. I worked with them during our children’s college years. I think lucifer is the training leader for there customer service teams. They are horrible. Get away if possible. Do a consolidated loan and move it.;jkclx7c;krf8e7dg;6wfu6ut7
Nelnet is really reasonable to work with .. just don’t ignore it .. call them;jk9olxi;56x3y92o;6wfu6ut7
Paying off student loans unfortunately results in a credit hit. In your case a loan was paid off and a new one taken on. It’ll take a couple months but should go back up;jk9u7dk;m9byqe7;6wfu6ut7
Unless you’re getting a mortgage or car loan any time soon I wouldn’t worry about it.;jk9zmki;q33vr;6wfu6ut7
What exactly changed on your credit report? Did Great Lakes account show closed $0 balance? If that is the case give it a few weeks and the new Nelnet accounts should show up.Also what open accounts do you have? Sounds like you have a very thin credit file once the Nelnet accounts show up I recommend you get 2 decent credit cards. Also if you already have some ask your existing cards for a limit increase.;jk9ys1c;xh5f5;6wfu6ut7
"Your ""credit score"" is just an estimate. It takes all the data from your credit report and assigns factors to it to come up with the score. As ""provider"" is not one of the factors we can assume something else is going on here.One of the factors is though debt to income ratio. It probably went down due to some lag in the paperwork where they think you suddenly have double the debt and therefore your ratio is worse. I imagine it will resolve in a few months.";jka9bty;f5rwkf54;6wfu6ut7
credit doesn’t matter until you need to use it (open a new card mortgage etc). If you aren’t going to make any moves then it doesn’t matter because your credit will recover over time as you make on time payments.;jk9ynju;16vscpjy;6wfu6ut7
theres not much you can do. just pay off ur debts on time and itll go back & beyond your old score. my credit score took a 30 point hit a few months ago when i maxed out one of my cards even tho i paid it off quickly without any interest charge. its already back to being 15 points higher than it was before i maxed out my cards and i havent even really been doing anything besides paying my shit off. credit scores are fickle. if youre not applying for credit in the next month or so i wouldnt worry about it.;jkao21b;475ckncg;6wfu6ut7
Why is America such a hellscape?;jkavq5r;j281a;6wfu6ut7
If you aren't in the process of borrowing money it doesn't matter. Go on with your life.;jkarvor;iqwee;6wfu6ut7
I’m guessing it’s a “oldest account closed” situation. My student loans were also transferred from Great Lakes to Nelnet. However I’m a little older - my student loans are relatively new my oldest credit line is 19 years old. My Vantage credit score has been at a low of 811 in Jan to a high of 818 in May this year. My FICO is 790 Jan low to 815 high in May this year.;jka1vym;zr1av;6wfu6ut7
It'll go back don't worry. If you're looking at credit karma or similar it's using an estimated score - account transfers don't actually impact your credit but right now it's seeing it as closing an account and opening a new one once thr account transfer is accurately reflected it will go back to where it should be.;jkaak5a;gtlbu;6wfu6ut7
I want to start by sayings it's very unhealthy to micromanage your credit scores. It also shows a complete lack of knowledge about credit scoring and how credit scores are used.1. Loans changing servicers does not reset their date. Would have zero impact on credit scoring.2. 30 points is literally nothing.3. It was probably a credit card balance exceeding 30% utilization.;jk9q6ig;qn1i3;6wfu6ut7
A 30 point hit is meaningless. Ignore it.;jka3z3m;7b8zz;6wfu6ut7
I had Great Lakes that went to Nelnet. No change for me though.;jk8u9fj;s4szu;6wfu6ut7
Yep mine took a hit too! 25 pts;jk9a3wu;9uldzxov;6wfu6ut7
Following as well just got my credit score back up to where I was a few years ago and once it transfers I’m sure it will drop;jk9div1;1ycs5dza;6wfu6ut7
It'll bounce back in a month or two. Nothing to do about it.;jk9ey6b;d3yrz;6wfu6ut7
Following. This happened to my husband’s loans.;jk9ezlo;3ybraho0;6wfu6ut7
My credit score went down 90 points with a federal student loan transfer last year;jk9h18a;x814n;6wfu6ut7
I received loan forgiveness then great lakes asked for their money back because of things being tied up in the courts. Then they moved my loan over to Nelnet. I'm not sure if I should wait for my loans to be forgiven again or just pay them back. At the moment no interest is accruing but I also hate having loans just hanging in the air.;jk9j4l2;d653w;6wfu6ut7
Same thing happened to me but new loan through Nelnet eventually showed the same age as G.L and credit went back up. Took a couple weeks.;jk9ls56;jp7df52g;6wfu6ut7
Your credit score will probably go back to how it was in the next month or two.;jk9mgnm;krlqj;6wfu6ut7
Really? I’m going to pay it off now. I don’t think student loan foregiveness will even happen;jk9mnj1;vhmhe2c3;6wfu6ut7
Oh no! I haven't checked my score in ages but I'm in this transition too. Here's hoping ot self corrects. Sounds like it's an issue of the accounts being in flux.;jk9nnim;110m3n;6wfu6ut7
Mine took a big hit for about a week. Once the Nelnet account shows up it will be back where it was.;jk9o222;kt719tf;6wfu6ut7
I suspect a different factor is in play.  When a debt is sold from one service provider to another the original terms still apply (Open date balance original balance etc...). How did you find out your credit score dropped?* A new credit inquiry (score drops)* Through an online service and you carried over/increased your revolving debt this month?* You applied for a new credit card or financing somewhere?* Many other potential reasons.;jk9p4j9;qpp13x60;6wfu6ut7
If it’s a one for one evening out situation you should see your credit score bounce back in 30-90 days.;jk9qik6;ckg37p7o;6wfu6ut7
I obtain my credit score from my credit union and received no such hit when my loans transferred from Great Lakes to Nelnet;jk9qn5c;z909m;6wfu6ut7
It will even out in time. This happens whenever a revolving credit line is closed. Same reason they say not to close a card. Unfortunately happens when you pay off loans or they are bought by another servicer.;jk9s8d5;999gh;6wfu6ut7
I had loans through OSLA which decided to stop servicing federal loans so it got transfered to Advantage. That hasn't been reported on my credit report yet but the removal of the loans gave me a decent bump about 16 points 759 -> 775. I suspect I'm gonna take a similar hit to you which is frustrating as hell.;jk9sm29;th3cic4g;6wfu6ut7
It will probably resolve itself in a month or two;jk9xkel;awwgsob3;6wfu6ut7
This is super odd because mine just showed I paid it off from GL and it hasn't shown up as a nelnet account yet.  I thought they said just servicer was changing why is it a new account?;jk9y6qu;eolld;6wfu6ut7
My old Fedloan accounts that I have paid off / have a $0 balance on transferred too.  I got a credit-checking site alert asking me to verify.  I don't think my score was impacted.;jk9zo5s;1ivlil7c;6wfu6ut7
I also had my loans transferred from Great Lakes to Nelnet. No hit to my credit score as of writing. It does say credit will be updated tomorrow so we will see!;jk9zu1t;awp8i;6wfu6ut7
From the email they sent:Now that we are servicing your federal student loan(s) you may see some changes on your credit report. Great Lakes reported your account(s) as closed due to the transfer. Nelnet then opened a new account(s) with the nationwide consumer reporting agencies with the same total balance for each loan you have. Within 90 days of the transfer these changes will be reflected on your credit report and Nelnet will continue to report on your federal student loan(s).;jka1c3x;99r5l;6wfu6ut7
Strange.  Just checked.  My loans age was not affected post move to Nelnet.  I am using Credit Karma.;jka1vfu;14z34x;6wfu6ut7
It'll update to correct info in a couple months.;jka2535;826stw95;6wfu6ut7
Are you certain the great lakes account shows as closed on the report? It's possible that your report is (temporarily) showing both as open accounts depending when they report to the agencies.;jkabzp6;m0c55fnc;6wfu6ut7
My loan servicer has changed **three** times during the payment pause and once prior to that. Nothing you can do about it.;jkad59h;mlmyfnoq;6wfu6ut7
Same boat. I dropped 15 points to an 820. Your score will go back up over time. No need to worry.;jkag0o7;3plyngnj;6wfu6ut7
Interesting. I have loans that were transferred from Great Lakes to Nelnet. Haven’t checked my credit recently. I hope if my credit has been dinged they figure out how to fix it.;jkage0m;536qddm7;6wfu6ut7
Sort of related but does anyone know *why* they do this? I had loans move from Great Lakes to Nelnet to StudentAid to MOHELA. The last one was for PSLF purposes but I didn’t ask for any of the other ones.;jkahobv;9spct;6wfu6ut7
Hey so the same thing happened to me when my loans transferred from Greatlakes to Nelnet two months ago. My credit didn't drop because with Great Lakes I only had one loan showing on my credit it was all the loans combined into one. However Nelnet has six different loans showing on my credit report and each of them shows the open date as the date the loan was taken out. So for this reason my credit has six more aged accounts rather than one. I think yours will update within a month to backdate the loans to show when they were actually opened so your score should go back up.;jkatl8d;dy3hycqu;6wfu6ut7
Mine did the same moved from GL to Nelnet it leveled out in about a month. It can take longer in other cases I guess.;jkb00dt;s3bh1n4k;6wfu6ut7
I was wondering why mine dropped but it's 800 so it doesn't really matter. This think there's be a protocol in place that for student loans that it goes back to the origination date.;jkb36jk;sl3dbusy;6wfu6ut7
"ITT: people giving WAY too much importance to a credit score model that no real lender uses. don't worry about vantage score; FICO(8) is what you want";jkbcxuc;5njvw;6wfu6ut7
Shoot I moved from Navient to Great Lakes this summer so I'd be eligible for student loan forgiveness since mine at Navient where in the one bucket not eligible for it. I didn't take a hit at all. I did however pay 2 private student lands and Credit Karma hit showed me a -25 points for paying each one off a -50 point drop. However my Fico didn't show a drop. I still haven't shown an uptick for that like I thought I should last thing I need is another huge drop changing to Nelnet.;jkbfirn;hufxm;6wfu6ut7
Mine just changed from greater lakes to Nelnet I didn’t experience any change in credit score. My loans have been income driven payment of $0 for 10 years though..;jkbg4rb;78rj2ei4;6wfu6ut7
Thank you OP.  I just figured out why my credit score went down recently -- my student loans were also recently transferred to Nelnet and also I thought perhaps because Covid-related payment moratoriums are expiring...?  I haven't made a payment yet because I graduated August 2022.    I have no idea how to raise the score again.  I assume that if you pay on time the score will come back up.  It IS strange though.  That's the only thing that changed for me too.;jkbrvrk;immqy;6wfu6ut7
I’m in the same boat and my accounts all show up at their original age just under the new name. Could be worth calling them to correct? Or you may need to go to the credit companies themselves;jkc2qnm;5szeu;6wfu6ut7
7 months more or less. Just make credit card payments on time. Great news is if the new new owners of your debt try to contact you about it. Deny deny deny. Says nithing about it. Chances are your debt was sold off and since you dont have a contract with the new owners of your debt. You owe them nothing.;jkcifg4;9aypimmt;6wfu6ut7
Ohhhhh. My credit took a 30 pint hit last year and for the life of me I couldn’t figure out why all this time. This is probably why!;jkcjs0d;dlrur;6wfu6ut7
That’s a bummer… when did you graduate? I graduated last year so I’ve only been accumulating the loan(s) for a few years but I also went from Great Lakes to Nelnet automatically recently.;jkcke0f;bykc3;6wfu6ut7
It will resolve itself. Took mine about 3 weeks. After the transfer my score was actually higher. No effects to account dates either.;jkcobgi;h1gei;6wfu6ut7
Do you think it's getting double counted since they just had a certain amount of debt registered to a previous company and now have this new one?;jkafyrg;7t5o9;pe0hct3
Uhhh mine took that same plummet almost 6 months ago and hasn’t recovered because my average open credit age is not nearly as long as it was prior…. I’m still waiting for the bounce back….;jkbxbt2;15mxbb;pe0hct3
Absolutely! I’m wondering if it’s calculating the hit based on a new loan showing a large amount or because an account has been closed. Hopefully we can figure something out;jk8o0kx;6wfu6ut7;pevq601
Same here. Glad I saw this post bc I had no idea why;jk9ica9;527haopj;pevq601
In the same boat and mortgage officer is not happy 😭;jk9e3op;2u8y4u5e;pevq601
"Same. Went from GL to Mohela since i applied for PSLF. What I believe is happening is that it appears as though one of our accounts closed. So that impacts our credit for the time being until we build a bit more. This was semi confirmed when credit karma sent me an email explaining that my credit score dropped due to me paying off an account and that it would quickly recover. The only account i've ""paid off"" is the great lakes one.";jk9mi6l;4njgiet1;pevq601
If this is something that just happened then it is probably showing the value of the loans twice in your credit report once it is closed on the report it should jump back up. I’ve had this happen before. I’ve also had the opposite happen when I used a balance transfer it jumped up cause one account was paid. A few weeks later it went back down when it showed on the transfer account.;jk9kvfx;9ljgxz0y;pevq601
Same exact thing. 25 point hit;jk9tl8m;rodaa;pevq601
Me too. I had one acct with Great Lakes now I have THIRTEEN accounts with Nelnet. It’s like every semester I took out two loans (one sub and one unsub) and they made each loan it’s own account??? Totally a nightmare;jkaxx35;8ev1zjl8;pevq601
I'm in this situation too. My loans were transferred a few days ago from Great Lakes to Nelnet.;jka6f8i;ax68j683;pevq601
Oh yeah I'm joining the boat guys;jk9dv6o;2rgdabgc;pevq601
Mine transferred from myfedloan to Nelnet and I didn't take a hit. Oddly my score has gone *up* about 30 points since the start of the year. Must be the way the transfer specifically from Great Lakes happened. If they don't correct the issue hopefully someone is able to set up for a class action because this will easily affect people's ability to borrow at expected rates.;jkafypx;ia64c;pevq601
When it got removed during the transfer how much did it put your score up? Mine went up 16 points but it's gonna go back down again;jk9sqd2;th3cic4g;pevq601
My transferred from/to same companies and did not take any hit. Not sure why it would?I have had my credit report frozen for a couple years now maybe that helped?;jkak0q2;br448;pevq601
25 points is just noise.;jka85f3;5t9nk;pevq601
Same here!;jkaawlx;7rhqi;pevq601
Same situation. Mine transferred within the past year and the age didn't change. Weird.;jkabqew;ly6vo;pevq601
Happened to me everything went back up after a month or two;jkamktv;76icy;pevq601
Same here. Mine has dropped about 20 so far. Hopefully it'll go back up. I worked my butt off to get it to where it was.;jkazhte;14uemp;pevq601
I got really excited when credit karma emailed me my student loan balance had reached $0.;jkcp1ri;12ov7e;pevq601
"Credit Karma was the original way I discovered the drop in my score- it is showing as decreased in my Mint account as well. Do you know a better way to check? &#x200B;This was helpful information btw thank you!";jk8qqs9;6wfu6ut7;t6qw4oky
Credit Karma doesn't use a proprietary in house score they use Vantage instead of FICO.  Vantage scores are real credit scores used by real banks to decide credit applications just like FICO scores.  It's just that FICO is used more commonly so people are more familiar with it.;jk8z7qc;65l4ww2;t6qw4oky
FICO is a bad system. It’s a horrible joke that has real negative effects on people who do not deserve it. I would be willing to wager that their algorithm is one of the worst algorithms in regular business use. That’s your answer.;jk98l94;qppwtrnq;t6qw4oky
Average age of account has an effect on FICO scores. So yes closing a long standing account and replacing it with a new credit account would absolutely affect their score.;jkavxrn;bpy07;t6qw4oky
Fico still factors average age into their score model. Closing an old account can affect the average especially if the consumer has had that student loan account since college as there’s a chance it’s their oldest line. Closing oldest line = lower average age of accounts.;jkbk4e2;qmhhz;t6qw4oky
Funny I was trying to remember where mine started and I think it could have been Nelnet also;jk8qkdc;6wfu6ut7;bl3ifzfb
> I'm so confusedTLDR Great Lakes and Nelnet have been owned by the same parent entity since 2018 so it's redundant.;jk9vzrt;bcxk0;bl3ifzfb
Also same... I don't understand the point.;jk9rmzp;jbvul8q;bl3ifzfb
Mine switch from GL last summer to NelNet and I made an account. I tried to make a payment that month but there were already headed back to GL. Such a fucking ridiculous scam.;jkar4d5;5d1inbhv;bl3ifzfb
Same for me number of accounts went through the roof when my loans transferred from GL to Nelnet;jk9oxti;4tgp85ya;j0glz
25 accounts opened?! Holy cow. Did Nelnet divide your loans into separate accounts or something?!;jkafolh;6opw0lcy;j0glz
Yeah I was wondering about this because mine are divided like this too… and wondering about the repayment based on this;jkb54ll;ieba0;j0glz
That's great news!Something definitely feels wrong here because a loan servicer transferring a loan shouldn't have any impact on the loan holderI've had other loans change servicers and never encountered a situation like other commenters are mentioning;jkafo9h;dbv4pplu;11cjun
For Vantage which is not the actual credit score.  FICO is not affected which is the score that matters.;jk8uifk;54d01sls;lstvn72e
FICO is looking okay! It was the Vantage score that dropped;jk8ur37;6wfu6ut7;54d01sls
That's so great that your job pays towards it! I have my under and grad through them too (and now NelNet). I'm cautious about starting repayment with the pending forgiveness;jkb0pio;6wfu6ut7;4khe4wg
You need to check that asap! Nelnet just took like $380 from my sister's paycheck when her loans transferred from GL to Nelnet too. I think she previously had them in forbearance but she had no prior payment arrangements with Nelnet for the loans transferred. However she also just graduated from grad school.;jka89wg;ax68j683;c9jya
I'm so interested to hear how this goes in the long term- I hope it is sorted out sooner than later;jkaw437;6wfu6ut7;7ocykucst
Oh God there goes my husband’s score then. He has like 6 or 8 loans I think I’m not even sure but it was all under Great Lakes as one. Oh Lordy.;jk9fcj9;3ybraho0;62338
Same situation here. I’m trying to just not fret too much and hope it pops back up within a year or so… not a helpful answer but just letting you know this is something likely happening to many others.;jka5gdm;112ws9;62338
I heard about this as well. I'm considering moving my student loan to another loan service provider.;jkcp27a;ax68j683;krf8e7dg
I had this a few months ago too and it was a quick lesson to set up autopay for my credit cards. I think I was a day off but it read the utilization high;jkaqciv;6wfu6ut7;475ckncg
Have no idea why you are getting downvoted these kids have issues;jka4dwj;7b8zz;qn1i3
Same but mine went up like 20 points rather than down. For me I think it's because I went from 1 loan to 5? Really don't know though.;jk9ombd;4zjkmk04;s4szu
When mine moved my credit went up ~80 pts because it looked like I paid off $XXXXX loans and then when the loans reappeared it went down ~100 pts. It did not happen instantenously. As Blom mentioned it leveled out a couple of months later.;jkb5g9k;f9nz7;7t5o9
No. The account closure is reported the same time the new account is reported.;jkb2zlo;ksml4;7t5o9
It’s because those were old accounts so now our average credit age has been seriously cut;jk9c16p;17ix7x;6wfu6ut7
I'm also in this boat.;jk9corv;ryv7q2xd;6wfu6ut7
FWIW I went from Navient to Mohela and it didn’t impact my credit at all. There was a few months that my credit showed no student loans and that they had been paid. Then Mohela showed up. Nothing changed when the loans were paid and nothing changed when the loans showed back up. I’m doing PSLF too.;jkak0av;pl7urwuo;4njgiet1
I think people are also looking at Credit Karma scores which aren’t actual FICOs. CK just sees you have a loan that wasn’t there on the last check assumes it’s new then gives a score estimate.;jkb2ys7;8xo436c9;9ljgxz0y
That’s exactly how mine is showing up now too but my score hasn’t take a hit at all.;jkb2s2f;1zselzm3;8ev1zjl8
I had Nelnet back in the day from a tech college and they did the same shit. Each class I took they did a “disbursement” and counted that as separate loans even though I was going through a specific program that moved you through courses. It wasn’t like I was signing up for random classes. And each of these separate loans *had its own interest rate*. Like 13 loans of about $1500-$2500 at like 6% interest (It may have been higher I joined the army afterwards and the SCRA caps interest rates at 6%). It was nearly impossible to pay off. Great Lakes never had me set up like that. Fuck Nelnet.;jkbbdk2;13y6wz;8ev1zjl8
Not if you’re in the process of getting a mortgage and it dropped you from preferred range to “human garbage” (what I assume banks think based on my experience with their financial services.);jka8sju;5cdx0coz;5t9nk
"Not if you’re trying to get a loan and it drops you from one category to another. Banks don’t give a fuck *why* your credit is suddenly lower. Sure the branch manager might understand. But the branch manager isn’t the one making a decision to give you a loan; That honor goes to a banking algorithm which calculates how much money the bank will make on your loan. And if your credit score suddenly drops during that process the algorithm could *very* easily go “hah never mind. Get fucked loser.”";jkb47he;j6bz8;5t9nk
Mint is also showing you a Vantage score (I think they have the same parent company).You'll need a FICO score.  Many banks and credit card companies give access to FICO for free so check those first.Worst come to worst you can pay for an up to date FICO score at myFICO.com.;jk8r06u;t6qw4oky;6wfu6ut7
"Credit kharma uses Vantagescore. Biggest different between FICO is that vantage counts ""average age of OPEN accounts"" while Fico uses ""average age of accounts"". So for Fico it doesn't matter if the account is open or closed it still counts towards your length. On vantage once the account is closed it no longer counts toward your length of history. Just ignore credit kharma scores. You can get a free FICO experian 8 score from Experian app and a free equifax 8 score from Myfico app.";jk94v7g;s7cvztlb;6wfu6ut7
Experian scores are free through their app.;jk9l1fn;zwsu3;6wfu6ut7
I go straight to experian. You can setup a free account and you can see pretty much everything about your credit.;jk9zmmx;4dk0x1pk;6wfu6ut7
Vantage is useless.  FICO is used almost universally.;jk91eft;t6qw4oky;65l4ww2
Vantage may be a real score but it’s barely used in credit decisions.The owners of the Vantage score (the big three credit reporting bureaus) have a vested interest in pumping up the viability of Vantage scores because they want a share of the money that goes to FICO.;jk96ivy;mvgyk;65l4ww2
I disagree. The relative stability of our financial system to date shows that it works reasonably well at what it's designed for: assessing risk to the bank. It's far from ideal but it's good enough for actuarial purposes.;jk9rilb;p9qxi95o;qppwtrnq
"The algorithm is pretty straightforward ""Do you pay your bills on time?"". If you do that your score will land in the mid 700s which is enough to get the ""Prime"" rates when borrowing. The remaining range up to 850 doesn't mean much of anything.";jk9wiuf;bcxk0;qppwtrnq
I had to go look it up.  Nelnet owns GL but the two kept their loans separate.  Now nelnet is taking over all loans by October this year. So no  we are not going crazy lol;jk8rqnh;bl3ifzfb;6wfu6ut7
Your Average age of credit took a hit due to the new accounts. It'll even out after you make a few payments and drop over time assuming the debt lowers and payments are made in time.;jka6hw5;18x7yf7f;6wfu6ut7
I'm guessing there is a lot of selling-off of student loan assets at a discount given the uncertainty around whether they will be worth anything at all in the near future.If most people here don't qualify for Federal student loan forgiveness then I'm probably wrong on that theory.;jkb3l2l;6tu1t;jbvul8q
Yea I read the change started March of last year. Redunkulous;jkax7ou;bl3ifzfb;5d1inbhv
Like I said they didn't use the right code.  It only matters for the first reporting period.;jkaq59n;11cjun;dbv4pplu
"No lender uses Vantage.  Vantage is meaningless.  If you like Credit Karma for a reason other than its score okay but do understand the score it gives you is pretty meaningless and is basically there to make you open the appIE ""yay your score went up 4 points click here to see why!""""Oh noes your score went down 10 points click here to see why!""Honestly just from being on this subreddit I'm beginning to hate Credit Karma.  The number of freakouts over their score on this subreddit is a lot and its all wasted energy and pointless stress.  You are fine.";jk8utk9;54d01sls;6wfu6ut7
Having more accounts is generally better for credit scoring algorithms.;jk9mx8r;dqjzelsl;3ybraho0
Not necessarily true. You can have it where both show up at the same time.;jkbma5g;ukrc4;ksml4
When my mortgage changed servicers (twice) it maintained the same age of account. Same when my Costco credit card changed from Amex to Citi. Does it really not work that way with student loans?;jk9hrag;3jdqe;17ix7x
That's not how it works.;jk9pqeg;qn1i3;17ix7x
Shouldn't be.  First off Great Lakes has traditionally been a servicer not a lender and second any of my college loans always showed an account age that began when the load was dispersed not when it was last shuffled between servicers.OP should check this.;jkb8im9;11f37f;17ix7x
That is odd I transfered from Navient to Great Lakes last Sept to be eligible for forgiveness and I didn't take a hit at all closing the Navient account despite it being 15+ years old. But I did take a hit paying off 2 other smaller student loans lol.;jkbfpsw;hufxm;17ix7x
Weird. Mine shows nothing right now and credit karma at least claimed that a paid off account was reported to trans union. The whole thing is just a shit show to begin with honestly;jkalxrf;4njgiet1;pl7urwuo
Yep I had credit karma showing me docked -50 -25 each for paying off 2 private student loans so around 760 score. I went to buy a car and my Fico was at 810+ recovered or never dropped like CK showed.;jkbfzms;hufxm;8xo436c9
Credit Karma gives you VantageScore which is a product of the three credit bureaus. VantageScore competes with Fair Issac's FICO model. While FICO is still the dominant scoring product there are some lenders like Capitol One that use VantageScore instead of FICO.;jkbnpqm;61jne;8xo436c9
Oh no that makes me nervous!!! Thank you for the heads up;jkbc1pq;8ev1zjl8;13y6wz
Even then it's still noise it's just noise that affects you. Your score will swing 25 points if you *sneeze* the day before. Within any one week your score can swing 50 points just because it *can*.;jkan5qp;5t9nk;5cdx0coz
This was very helpful- I was able to check FICO through American Express and it wasn't impacted. Thank you again for the help!;jk8v097;6wfu6ut7;t6qw4oky
"Thank you for this!&#x200B;Edited: You're right they both source information from Intuit.";jk8rj8f;6wfu6ut7;t6qw4oky
Vantage is pretty nice when it allows a creditor to make a soft pull for pre-approval so you don't take a FICO credit hit just to be denied;jka1tjs;6l6akszl;t6qw4oky
It's barely used _exclusively_ in credit decisions. Banks often use multiple scores to make a decision so it's entirely reasonable to assume that VantageScore _is_ used in a lot of credit decisions without stating that's it's used _instead_ of FICO.;jk9r9nt;p9qxi95o;mvgyk
Interesting. Thanks for sharing.;jkbmh6t;jbvul8q;6tu1t
> Honestly just from being on this subreddit I'm beginning to hate Credit Karma.And justifiably so.  CK is marketed as a credit-help tool when in reality it's a data scraping and credit advertising app.Also: https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/01/ftc-finalizes-order-requiring-credit-karma-pay-3-million-halt-deceptive-pre-approved-claims;jk934n1;t6qw4oky;54d01sls
I’ve had quite a few landlords that were more than happy to have my printed CreditKarma score for the application so I have no complaints on its use! I try to keep all of my scores up regardless;jk8yu3q;6wfu6ut7;54d01sls
Vantage scores are used more often than you think.  Lots of small time credit applications for things like apartments go through Vantage scoring.  Also some larger banks use it for credit cars and loan applications.  FICO is still far more common but to say Vantage is meaningless and no lender uses Vantage is just blatantly false.;jk8zgql;65l4ww2;54d01sls
But more accounts where the current balance is the same as the starting balance is not good.;jk9nkc0;62338;dqjzelsl
Yes. They legit closed it and then opened new accounts. Even though those companies are the same company now.;jkadslx;p1p02;3jdqe
I took an 11 pt hit when Cap One bought a Visa acct I had. Nothing else had changed (?);jkaha76;qdc0u;3jdqe
Yes it does.  People saying otherwise have bogus loan providers or are just incorrect.;jkb8o2p;11f37f;3jdqe
It’s not how it’s _supposed_ to work to be fair.  The new servicer should be acknowledging the original loan date.;jk9u4bm;et4s7;qn1i3
Age of current open accounts on your credit report absolutely affect your credit rating.;jka2avc;h9ldi;qn1i3
Yeah I would definitely go through and make sure they haven’t set you up like that. And I would find out if you can have your loans moved to another company or make sure they can’t do that to you.;jkbfyjv;13y6wz;8ev1zjl8
This is interesting- I’ve never experienced that before! Is it usually high card utilization that causes it?;jkcnoqn;6wfu6ut7;5t9nk
Vantage and FICO have different algorithms and while the scores are sometimes similar they are often wildly different.A hard pull is a couple of points it's not really a big deal to do an inquiry.;jkah36m;t6qw4oky;6l6akszl
That may be true but VantageScores are almost never used for mortgages.Only a bank that does portfolio loans (meaning they hold on to the loans) would ever consider it.;jk9tysy;mvgyk;p9qxi95o
That isn't for a loan and a landlord isn't a professional they are just a person who is trying to make a decision and maybe they don't know the difference either.  If you had a landlord happy to accept that then you had a landlord happy to not actually run your credit.  Good for you that that worked but I'm telling you Vantage score is not used by lenders or any other financial institution.Just so you are clear there are three credit bureus Experian Transuninon and Equifax.  They all FICO and all lenders go off their scores.  Vantage is something places like Credit Karma use its a totally different score and its not actually used by any financial institution.  Trying to keep your Vantage score up while not tracking your FICO score is not a great idea because there are things that would make your Vantage go up but your FICO go down and FICO is what matters.  Your Vantage score could plummet 300 points and no bank would care.Most of the time its going to go the other way where Credit Karma tells you your score is 760 when in fact its 640 and then you get confused as to why you are offered such poor rates on a loan or have a credit application rejected.  The purpose of Credit Karma is not to help you track your credit its to put your eyes in front of adds for credit cards and personal loans.  I wouldn't go as far as to say its a scam but it is walking that line.;jk9ybz9;54d01sls;6wfu6ut7
Even when Vantage scores are used the primary scoring seems to be proprietary scores at those banks.;jk96og3;mvgyk;65l4ww2
Well if an individual or a company uses Vantage as a quick check for roughly what your credit is rather than an actual hard pull they can do that if they are thinking about renting a place to you and they arent looking to lend you money they are just wanting to know if you have abysmal credit. Vantage isnt FICO but you arent going to have an 800 FICO and a 400 Vantage so its somewhat reasonable for that.But it isn't what is used if you actually want to get a loan.  If you actually want to USE your credit.  And if all you track is Vantage and you are reactionary and change the way you do things based on what your Vantage score does you are more liable to hurt your credit than help it.  It is honestly better to just ignore it and get your ACTUAL FICO score if you want to check it.  Vantage score is why over and over again in this subreddit you see people posting about how they have a 770 credit score so why were they rejected for XYZ loan or why were they offered an APR of 18% instead of 4%.  People think that score is real and it is not.;jk9yx4t;54d01sls;65l4ww2
> Vantage scores are used more often than you think. got a source for that claim?;jk9365a;t6qw4oky;65l4ww2
Right. I don’t know how the payments were allocated (before the pause)—we just sent our single lump sum every month. I could look I guess but doesn’t feel like it matters much now.;jk9p7sp;3ybraho0;62338
I doubt they are supposed to be able to close the original account and open a new one without your signature even if all the information is the same.;jkalkw0;eyp4l;p1p02
They are the issue is they aren't showing all the ontime payments anymore. All of mine show the correct origination date but only 1 payment each instead of the ~50 they should be showing.;jk9z9bl;4dk0x1pk;et4s7
Having had some experience with Nelnet I’m so fucking thankful to have paid that loan off. But this was my experience. They are a shitty predatory company.;jka0pun;136n72;et4s7
It's not that big of a deal but it is a tangible benefit to not receive a hit to your credit of any size;jkalf65;6l6akszl;t6qw4oky
There are a _lot_ more kinds of loans than mortgages like auto loans personal loans etc.;jk9y17o;p9qxi95o;mvgyk
> f you had a landlord happy to accept that then you had a landlord happy to not actually run your credit. A+ quote here;jka7qzm;3qjif;54d01sls
"You're absolutely right about landlords not caring about the credit score I am in a small town and everyone knows everyone else. I found my apartments through word of mouth for years and a ""credit check"" was opening up Credit Karma and showing him as we sign the lease. They know I work for XYZ down the street and half the people that move around here know the same real estate agent to find them a place to stay. I've watched every one of my landlords offer someone a job when they couldn't meet bills. It's lovely but it also comes with a lot of real-world learning. I'm learning a lot about the difference between the two from this post. I appreciate the time you have put into it. Just from personal research and because Vantage is so volatile- is it more beneficial for someone renting 1 year leases to check Vantage scores then?  I am trying to analyze why it is so common around here.";jkatfxf;6wfu6ut7;54d01sls
Vantage is a real score.  Credit score doesn't mean FICO score.  FICO is the largest company that does credit scoring models (there are actually about 50 different FICO scores).  And a hard pull will impact both Vantage and FICO scores.  A hard vs soft pull is not FICO vs Vantage FICO and Vantage are not types of credit pulls they are just different folrmulas used to calculate your score.;jkb9q9w;65l4ww2;54d01sls
Typically the payments are applied to any accrued interest first and then to the distribution with the highest interest rate.;jk9tnwc;62338;3ybraho0
Contest the legitimacy of the loan! Wouldn't that be wonderful if it disappears. Massive long shot.;jkamju5;i2x1r3l3;eyp4l
Nah student loans are their own weird little world of rule breaking.;jkblp2i;dshpa;eyp4l
This is the issue for me. I get my FICO score thru my credit card company- it states “many missed and late payments” as the reason for the 60 point drop this month. Never missed a loan or credit card payment in my life.;jka0hev;2jxgon3;4dk0x1pk
I’ve asked about this and they are constantly changing the dates of when they will count the prior payments (at least towards the life of your student loans but unsure for credit agencies) and was told by this summer at first now saying 2024… it’s still possibly changing again…;jkbxm73;15mxbb;4dk0x1pk
Everyone knows everyone in this town this is very accurate! <3 But I am thankful to learn so much from this thread;jkatnm3;6wfu6ut7;3qjif
Vantage is common because its free where as FICO you generall have to pay for or subscribe or do a hard pull for.  It just isnt the score lending instititions typically use.  If Vantage score has use for you as in you can use it to get a rental in your area then Im not going to try and say it doesnt have use. Just know the difference.In otherwords dont track your Vantage score actively change your behavior to doing things that make that score go up and think that that for sure translates to getting good terms on a loan or a mortgage.;jkau6ui;54d01sls;6wfu6ut7
Thanks I didn’t know that!;jka1bkj;3ybraho0;62338
What would happen if we rallied every single person who had this happen to contest the legitimacy at the same time?;jkazdbd;c3a7y;i2x1r3l3
If you get an account with experian(free) you can see exactly who is reporting what to them. It is very useful to see if there is anything that looks off.Edit: They also have a way to link phone and utility bills for people with short credit histories so they can build credit faster.;jka0pw9;4dk0x1pk;2jxgon3
https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.actionThis is where you can get your credit report 1x/yr/credit bureau for free. I like to do it in a 4-month round-robin fashion.If you can tell which is the bureau that this FICO is based on might be worth doing that first.Edit to add:If you are seeing inaccuracies take a look at the FTC's page on getting them corrected.https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/disputing-errors-your-credit-reportsThey have a sample letter to get you going on fixing the errors:https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/sample-letter-credit-bureaus-disputing-errors-credit-reportsAlso highly recommend to freeze your credit. It is now free to do from what I understand. https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-know-about-credit-freezes-fraud-alertshttps://www.usa.gov/identity-theft;jkasp97;g4ieb;2jxgon3
That's odd - I don't see that on my report. Just that the age of my credit dipped.;jkb5ig6;li7n8l1d;2jxgon3
This has been very informative-  I really appreciate it! I got pre-approved for a mortgage a little over a year ago and I remember that the scores were the same so I assumed there was no major discrepancy. This is the first time I have seen such a huge variance between the two however and a basic google search just shows that they are both important. I appreciate the real-life input as well;jkavrfx;6wfu6ut7;54d01sls
A class action lawsuit.;jkb6a14;e297pqv;c3a7y
To each their own but I wouldn’t link phone or utility bills.  They don’t need any more data. But at any rate y’all need to get a lawyer this is some class action shit if they don’t fix it especially for reporting late or missed payments.;jkad626;19y4mn5w;4dk0x1pk
So I just used it and for some reason it has mostly correct info but also has that I lived in some random state and had a residential number that I never had before in my entire life…. Super weird.  Was also missing a bunch of stuff too…;jkbz4r6;15mxbb;g4ieb
Yeah sometimes they are the same-ish just dont 100% count on them being the same in a way where you would get burned if they arent. Tracking Vantage for the general trend of your credit or to catch an accidental missed payment is useful...but dont be reactionary to small score changes for reasonable events (like paying off a debt and closing an account or a loan changing hands).;jkawhhc;54d01sls;6wfu6ut7
I meant more like gum up their system so hard that they are not able to provide proof for everyone within the time limit;jkbezzp;c3a7y;e297pqv
Just dispute it with the credit bureaus should sort it out quickly enough if you're not actively shopping for credit and relying on your current score.;jkalzpv;b4ld9;19y4mn5w
If you are seeing inaccuracies take a look at the FTC's page on getting them corrected.https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/disputing-errors-your-credit-reportsThey have a sample letter to get you going on fixing the errors:https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/sample-letter-credit-bureaus-disputing-errors-credit-reportsIf there's nothing but the address wrong I could be cautiously optimistic about it but my wary mind would have me looking at all three in case someone is using that to open credit in my name.Also highly recommend to freeze your credit.

My girlfriend recently informed me she has $12000 in credit card debt on 2 separate cards. $5000 on one card at 17% apr and on the 2nd card $7000 at 21% apr. She makes roughly $42000 a year. She lives with me and only pays for groceries. My suggestion to her was a balance transfer to a credit card that has 0% apr for 12 months and no transfer fees. I’ve never been in that type of debt though. Would you say that is a solid plan for her? Her monthly take home pay is roughly $2200 before bills which is just groceries phone insurance.- EDIT: there’s a 3% transfer fee but the 0% apr is for 21 months. She also only started her full time job end of January 2023. Debt was accumulated in 2022 from tuition ($5000) groceries ($unknown) therapy ($3000) and interest gains with Im sure misc spending also. I’m not asking for relationship advice from you. Just knowledge on balance transfers or personal loans mathematically as I’ve never been in debt so have no reference points.;13iflbv;b1wl5syk;
I had a GF years ago that had about 10k in cc debit. She was a full-time student so I recommended that she get a student loan with a considerably lower interest rate to pay it off. She took the advice got the loan and promptly spent all the $ on a massive shopping spree instead of paying off the cc debt.;jkaovee;4134t;b1wl5syk
Transferring to a 0% card *with a plan to put $x on the new card monthly knowing my income would allow for it* helped me pay off significantly more than that and be out of cc debt before the new card started accruing interest. I think the big question would be whether the math adds up for her to put down the right number per month before interest accrues.;jk9p6oq;15oha6;b1wl5syk
It may sound counter-intuitive but unless you can explain how she racked up 12k in credit card debt despite only paying for groceries a phone bill and insurance while making thousands a month balance transferring to a third card is not a solid plan. It points to a very likely scenario that once those first two cards are paid off she racks up debt again and now she's in even more debt.First figure out how she got that much into debt in the first place. Second figure out how much she has currently been paying towards that debt - has she only been paying monthly minimums or paying more? Third before you agree to help any further than that you should probably do a full review of her credit situation to make sure she's not hiding any other debt or defaulted on anything that may impact her credit score. After you go through those steps and now have a better grasp of the situation only then would it make sense for you to actually take a more active role in helping her dig out of her debt.;jk9krkw;235tt45;b1wl5syk
Most balance transfer options will give 0% interest but will charge a flat percentage as a transfer fee.  But it will typically amount to less than you're paying in interest on a larger balance at a high rate.  To save the most money I'd suggest she make the minimum payment on the 17% rate card and put all her extra money towards the 21% card monthly.  If she's only paying for food and her phone it's likely she can afford to put $1000-1500 per month against the debt right?  She should be able to pay off the cards in under a year if she can stick to that.;jk9ozve;dwj45;b1wl5syk
copy paste of a comment i made on a similar post:Luckily for credit cards there are several programs for you if you are struggling under high interest rates. One is called a DMP or debt management program in which you go through a government agency or govt authorized nonprofit and agree to budget counseling. You stop using your credit cards (all of them) and the interest rate drops down to 2% until the debt is paid off.I need to stress here that it is very important you don’t do debt consolidation or debt settlement or go through a predatory private company for this. Go through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Once again I repeat do not get distracted by an ad or someone trying to sell you something  and do some other predatory program for credit card debt.  Go through a government agency and do a DMP. In this program you pay every cent back but you have to do budget counseling and they get the interest rate down to 1.5%-2% as you pay it off.Info: https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-are-debt-settlementdebt-relief-services-and-should-i-use-them-en-1457/At the bottom is a way to get connected to an agency that could do a DMP for you.;jka1cdb;utybu;b1wl5syk
I racked up nearly the same amount after buying my home. Had no credit card debt whatsoever and had got nearly 12k at one point. It really can be as simple as groceries and buying things here and there necessary stuff for the house wasn't cheap but I didn't go overboard. A ton of tiny little things.I ended up consolidating it into a personal loan with a much better interest rate and minimum payment with an actual end date to paying it off something that the 2 cards didn't have if I kept paying them the way I was. Haven't touched the cards since except for emergencies only that I didn't have cash for.;jk9ytop;xglhs;b1wl5syk
Do a 6 or 12 month look back on her credit cards to see where she is spending her money and make a budget from it. She might not even realize how much money she is spending in certain categories.;jk9yscj;a4kuj;b1wl5syk
Maybe I’m missing something on the math here but based on what you say her and expenses are I imagine that can’t be more than $500 month in expenses which leaves $1700 to pay off that high interest debt. I’d suggest she put at least $1000 (if not more) per month to paying off the credit cards. Playing around with new credit cards with lower interest sounds like a dangerous game. The buck needs to stop here. This will help her understand the value of actually paying for something as well as what’s required to get to a position where she can actually start investing money.;jkaet7r;o6y43eh7;b1wl5syk
She brings home $2200 a month with no rent. Tell her to suck it up a few month a live like a hermit.;jkbs74u;skzf2qj;b1wl5syk
CORRECTION: was just informed card does have transfer fee of 3%.;jk9ijku;b1wl5syk;b1wl5syk
WHAT?  Does she not understand credit cards and only been making minimum payments?  How did she rack up 12k in credit card debt?How much does she have saved up in the bank?;jk9mvpz;4f2ycuv7;b1wl5syk
I’m kind of blown away by the amount of assumptions judgement and condescension sprinkled in here with what is pretty standard financial advice. OP told you exactly how her debt was accrued none of which signifies a “spending problem” of shopping or anything extravagant. Yes it’s the internet but you don’t know this person’s girlfriend her history or her situation. Some of the comments do NOT pass the vibe check. Kudos to OP and girlfriend for taking steps to get out of debt. It’s hard and shaming people for what seem to me like necessities certainly doesn’t help.;jkbwuk2;4qx9qr5;b1wl5syk
Consolidation loan with a medium to high interest rate is the way. And cut the cards up. Please anyone reading this with 12k in credit card debt. Cut the card up!! Fuck me. Quit letting the banks steal your money.;jkbi4g3;yhtzt00;b1wl5syk
It’s super difficult to get someone to stop using credit cards when it gets to huge amounts like this.     A long term solution is Zero credit cards **PERIOD.**Because those cards will keep being charged week after week by the hundreds. I had a family member who got wiped clean of $80000+ debt used that as a green light to rack up that much more debt. I’m amused how someone even spends *that* much. Above was in 2015 To this day still gets collection notices of up to $10000. It traumatized me which is why I’m on this subreddit.Anyways solution is zero credit cards to prevent this from occurring again;jkbrm7l;gsqxa;b1wl5syk
She needs to get a second job and throw all extra money against those credit cards. A 0% card isn't going to solve this problem.And she ought to be taking home **a lot** more than $2200/month if she makes $42000/year. Need to look at her paystub and make sure every deduction makes sense.;jk9jzrp;23mhm8a1;b1wl5syk
Does she even have any motivation to pay it off? It’s clear that YOU do but does she?;jkb5tpa;3o3l9sbd;b1wl5syk
She can put $1500/mo towards her debt and be done in a year. Rice and beans for groceries.;jkb71q1;nlo5s;b1wl5syk
Take out a personal loan pay off all the cards and stop spending credit card money. The interest on a personal loan will be much lower the payments will be more reasonable to actually pay the debt off and it converts it from revolving debt to structured debt. All wins.;jk9x0tk;9xo1w;b1wl5syk
The only issue is to balance transfer to a credit card with 0% apr for x amount of months is probably a new credit card offer but will the new card limit even be enough to be able to transfer 12k?;jk9q5g8;6jkbpy6d;b1wl5syk
I’ve done the balance transfer you suggest with $10k before. Most was used for necessities but there were some others on there. I had the old card number memorized number so when I got the new card I gave it to my partner to hold onto so I did not use it unless it was a true emergency (thankfully never needed to use it). Then I paid as much as I could each month and cut my recreational spending to $0. I made a budget and started learning valuable skills to move up in my career and earn more. It is absolutely possible and a good way to skip around high interest rates but requires extreme willpower and/or a good two-person system AND no other purchases on credit. This is key because if you can’t pay it off in full by the end of the promotional period you get hit with the full amount of interest anyway plus the 3% fee you paid in the beginning so it ends up costing more in the end.;jkatto8;qzgcj0s;b1wl5syk
Attack the debt try getting more hours or a second job to pay off quicker.;jkau6yr;14k5sn;b1wl5syk
Yes balance transfers work only if you stop spending. I have used balance transfers between four cards and did the snowball method. Started in fall 2021 and went from $27k down to $3k.;jkbdyzw;5ex19u7z;b1wl5syk
Take the 3% hit that will be less than $400  on your current balance it will be worth it to get away from those bandits. Securing a zero to low interest credit card transfer over a limited time will easily make up the difference.;jkbjkmv;i7eje;b1wl5syk
You have to solve the spending problem before you solve the financial problem.A balance transfer will just free her up to spend more if the underlying problem that got her here is not addressed first.;jkcmxdo;axxq1;b1wl5syk
If she decides to go with balance transfer make sure to read the terms and conditions carefully. If it's deferred interest then it's actually accruing interest but the interest is waived if you pay off the balance within the promotional period. But if you have balance the day after the end of promotional period then retroactive interest will be added to the balance.If it's not a deferred interest but regular balance transfer with 0 apr then at the end of the promo period interest will be applied to the remaining balance if there's any.;jkadrk7;3zl5v0rz;b1wl5syk
what's your current monthly take home income?what are your current ongoing monthly expenses?what are your debts broken out individually? amount owed? interest rate? minimum payment?;jka3al6;42vmi;b1wl5syk
You might need to help you with budgeting but do they even have zero interest zero transfer fee cards.  I can’t imagine a credit card doing that because they would make $0.  Transfers fees aren’t even bad from what you save on interest usually it’s only 3-5%.  I’ve never heard of balance transfer with no fee;jka4owf;4pblw16f;b1wl5syk
Highly recommend balance transfer but ONLY one credit card. The other ones don’t exist. Stopping the bleeding will help a lot. I help my friends with this sort of thing a lot and the constant reminder I give is.You don’t want to be in youre 40s with kids and you had to flush your 401k becuase of credit card debt and now you can no longer afford your - past lifestyle current lifestyle and future lifestyle all at the same time. It seems easy and in your 20s to get in and out of debt but it’s really your late 30s and 40s you’re endangering and you won’t have the hustle you do right now to set good habits.;jka6ovm;am640zf;b1wl5syk
She can turn this around. But you need to make sure you fix the root of the problem. Why did she go into debt? To buy clothes or to pay for food or something else? Pay off the highest APR first. Pay any extra possible to get this debt done asap.  This isn’t going away;jka87dj;kdw1m;b1wl5syk
If moving to a 0% card you need to calculate the monthly payments to get it paid off in the 12 months then set up automatic payments. Do not go past the free interest period.;jkaglyp;11yw5q;b1wl5syk
Your gf needs to go on a strict budget. Every month begins with anticipating expenses setting the budget defining the debt payoff goal and then making a plan to get to it. So if she expects that she can cashflow $800 set a goal of $1000 and get creative to make up the $200 if it’s part time work or whatever. Her debt is an emergency and she needs to deal with it like an emergency.;jkajzfz;7h1mkwmr;b1wl5syk
She’s paying 3% to save 14% over 21 months. Do it asap! The balance does not get paid off immediately might be 2-3 weeks so she still needs to pay that next payment. Also use this as a reset and don’t get in the trap of adding more debt while paying this off. Unless you have a big purchase/home improvement etc and need zero % short term financing but tread carefully!;jkaqfmb;y10xl;b1wl5syk
Most importantly you have to ensure that it doesn't happen again after that it doesn't really matter wether you transfer or not. Going forward consider she get an original style Amex that requires the previous months balance be paid off on the due date (they have a pay over time option and you need to make sure it's turned off). As to the current balance sure should tighten up and pay $1000/month and be done in a year.;jkatzxv;1518s6;b1wl5syk
If she an get that deal obviously take it. 3% transfer fee over 21 months is roughly 1.6% interest vs 21% and 17%Then don't let her put any new purchases on said cards.;jkbfh1f;btbax;b1wl5syk
I have helped my wife (girlfriend at the time) do the exact thing. 100% transfer to 0% interest card longer term the better you said 21 months which is great. Put as much money towards it every month as is possible. If you have 4 months left of the 0% period and it looks like you're not going to make it start looking at transferring again to new 0% cards.I did this multiple times for her it took like 4 years for her to get out of debt but she did finally using only her money. She felt great debt was paid her credit score improved and she learned valuable lessons along the way. Debt sucks. Use the 0% route. It's a gift from the CC companies so long as you don't lapse.Good luck.;jkbp072;eo2rmalz;b1wl5syk
I wouldn’t tell someone with a spending problem to open another card. She’s just going to transfer and remax the cards.;jkbpxbo;94o1d7ci;b1wl5syk
We had 35k on cc's until I took over finances from my wife in order to get my kid through college. What we did and it's tough is just change lifestyle for a couple years. No vacations (unless it's something like tent camping)  1 gift each for Christmas no stopping to get breakfast in the morning cut all unnecessary streaming services (get a fire stick and watch all the free programming you want) cancel your gym carpool to work plan meals and have leftovers for 3 days. Getting a zero % card is a great idea but even with that you have to put massive chunks of cash on the cards to get paid off quickly. Plan a strict budget and stick to it. It will be painful and there will be arguments. You have to be on the same page.;jkc2s0v;jbu9l;b1wl5syk
I used this method when I had accrued credit card and care credit debt. You have to be dedicated to paying it off Before the due date.  Going even a couple days past and you get hit with interest charge. You also have to be mindful about not running up new debt on the cards.;jkc3t87;aoqfe;b1wl5syk
"Read Ramit Sethi's advice on paying down the debt. The most important thing is making a plan and sticking to it. Before you can make a plan you need to know important details: when will the debt be paid off assuming she only pays the minimum payment? When will it be paid off if she were to pay extra 50–200 a month? Google""debt payoff calculator"" abd calculate the important numbers.";jkc78df;m2l2t;b1wl5syk
Here's what I would do.Before we even get to step one. You need to be ready to get out of debt and stay out if debt. Paying cash from here forward. An eftpos/debit card is cash as long as it's not a credit card.1) transfer both to the 0% for 21 months. This card shouldn't be kept in your wallet as it's not for spending. 2) close all other cards and make a commitment to not get into further debt.3) pay $150 a week on the 0% card. This will have it paid off before the 21 months. Even if she has 11 weeks where she misses the payment entirely bit do your best to not miss any. 4) close the 0% card when it's paid off. My steps might not be perfect. Between step 1 and 2 might be a good idea to get an emergency fund incase anything happens while you're paying off the debt. I would recommend reading Dave ramseys total money makeover. That the steps I'm following to pay off my own debt. I have about $3000 to go combined with my fiancee.;jkc96jm;qqxcq2ly;b1wl5syk
Don’t bother transferring to new cards. It’s easy to run those bills up as well. If she focuses solely on paying off the cards she can be done in 6 months or less if she picks up a side job making a few hundred extra dollars per month. If she wants out of debt a few hundred dollars of interest isn’t her problem it’s poor financial planning. She needs to get to work instead of opening up more lines of debt.;jkciuzu;4i2m925w;b1wl5syk
If she’s still a student have her take out student loans and use those to pay her credit card debt. At that point student loans are either forgiven by Biden or stay zero interest which is more manageable. No payments required until the whole pause ends whenever that ends up being who knows they’ve pushed it back for 2 years now. And even if interest payments resume it’ll still be very manageable compared to credit cards.;jkbnams;f1gptnxi;b1wl5syk
"Honestly she can pay all that off in 6 months if she wanted to. Of the $2200 she makes per month $200 for groceries and bills $1000 each into the 2 cc. I wouldn't even bother with the transfer honestly. She needs to learn how to ""suffer"" as she put herself in that situation she can eat beans and rice and not go out for 6 months. Hopefully she will learn from the pain of cc debt and be wiser the next time.";jk9xejc;105zip;b1wl5syk
Have her sign up for doordash and grubhub and sent her out on deliveries at night to help pay it off .  You can easily earn an extra $200-300 a week part timeYou guys can even go out together in the beginning.;jk9xnpe;j005m;b1wl5syk
attack the cause not the symptoms. your girlfriend has somehow amassed $12k in debt with a decent income and basically no bills. she is absolutely out of control. trying to get charged less interest is great and all but this debt is only the symptom your girlfriends out of control spending is the problem that needs to be dealt with.;jkblxy0;6o2i0uf;b1wl5syk
How close are you with this girlfriend and do you want to go through this stress for the rest of your life?;jkcamxh;jbm4z;b1wl5syk
Does she qualify for a consumer proposal?;jk9tt4n;irrs5;b1wl5syk
What card has 0% interest and a free balance transfer? I could use that on a card I'm paying off.;jkayqtc;13asq3;b1wl5syk
"There's a lot of good advice but I'd just like to thank her for her contribution to my chase Sapphire sign up bonus. without rockstars like her rewards programs wouldn't be as strong as they are. Anyway jokes aside - see what balance transfer cards she can be pre-approved for. You may see ""oh wow this one is 0% for 18 months!"" But there's a 0% chance of her being approved for it. You can do a pre-approval on chase capital one discover etc. Id recommend discover - no annual fees across the board or capital one has some pretty good no annual fee cards. Also call the card providers. Whenever I call to cancel accounts they try to offer low interest/no interest time periods. If you call and say ""we'd like to close the account and balance transfer to XYX"" they might say ""oh okay? We can match that"" - and you wouldn't have a transfer fee and the credit line continues to age and no hard pulls. Worth a shot. Worst that happens is they say no.";jkbksik;p7jrn;b1wl5syk
I used to work in finance. Every client I had who transferred credit card debt to a zero balance for a period of time card just charged up their old and their new card.Also those offers are only given to people with good credit scores. I assume that your girlfriend’s credit score is low.Sometimes credit card companies will lower your interest rate if you call and ask. It’s worth a try.;jkbjvaa;vindk;b1wl5syk
Does she have family or anyone willing to lend her money? back in the day when i was paying for school and everything on my own and got in a car crash i was something like.... 28k in debt? my cousin paid if off and i just paid him monthly.   \^This is not something i would recommend if they have not shown credibility.;jkaifz3;cy9zw;b1wl5syk
Good advice already given.  I suggest she immediately start an “emergency fund”.  200 / month for six months ($1200).  I understand this does not help pay off the debt and interest.  This is to cut up the cards and insure they never ever get used again.;jkanlvl;eel7d;b1wl5syk
Find a debt consolidation program. I was able to pull myself out of some 20 plus k loan through them. They charge you a small monthly fee and negotiate a lower rate with your creditors. Then they will give you a 36 months plan where you pay them one lump sum and they pay your creditors. It doesn’t hurt your credit at all.;jkbq76y;xq0fs;b1wl5syk
If you love her you should pay her debt for her;jkb4quw;cgp9h;b1wl5syk
That’s it? I’ve got 50k in revolving high interest debt. But I also make 6x that. Sometimes it’s paid off. Sometimes it’s not. There are months that I spend that alone on one card. Balance transfer. Be diligent.;jkbk4hl;a3n2d4pr;b1wl5syk
Whichever strategy you choose to get the interest down the base here is just going to be every dollar that isn’t essential goes to the debt. You probably know this she probably does also but doesn’t fully accept the meaning of essential. 1 year of no fun money will be well worth the peace of mind that will come from clearing this debt.;jk9xryr;tfmnz;b1wl5syk
Which bank/card has no fee on a balance transfer?  The APR is 0% on new purchases and on any balance you have transferred but there is usually a 3% or 5% fee charged to transfer the balance.;jkab67h;7cjcyqfw;b1wl5syk
Something is not adding up… from the amount of cc debt to her annual income to monthly take home. Not saying throw her to the wolves but unless you guys are very serious and you really see a life with this person I would let her figure it out herself.;jkabkhi;71aeuzzfx;b1wl5syk
Yes assuming she’ll actually be able to pay off the debt during the interest-free period.;jkacfp4;ar5rvels;b1wl5syk
I don’t think you need to transfer this balance.  It could help but it could also hurt the person if they haven’t fixed their spending.You can knock this out together.  Commit to staying in for the next few months and really pay this down.  Does she have anything she can sell?  Not like an heirloom but like video games or something?  Remember stuff like that are luxuries and if you’re serious about knocking out spending you have to be aggressive.  Ride it out together.  Doesn’t mean you pay for things but limit times going out to eat etc.  The fastest way to pay this off is to make more money.  Uber eats dog walking lawn mowing babysitting whatever. This isn’t an insurmountable problem.  Thankfully.;jkacsd8;6dfd7doh;b1wl5syk
On paper it can be a great idea. Could end up saving 1500 bucks give or takeHowever there are risks:1. More debt being that there is more credit limit now with a third card. This depends on the discipline. A safeguard on this would be to close the original two cards after the transfer is complete.2. If it's not paid off in a year I think typically these transfer deals retroactively charge interest from day one. Again with the discipline if it's not paid off in time you end up with all the interest accrued plus that 3% transfer fee so on paper a worse deal.;jkai1el;i26zy7o0;b1wl5syk
Balance transfer cards exist for a reason;jkao5a0;38xc4;b1wl5syk
How is her monthly take-home $2200 on a $42000/yr salary? 401k contribution? HSA/FSA?;jkasfz2;167khv;b1wl5syk
How much has she paid already? I helped someone in a similar position - and I found they had already paid way more than what they originally owed due to the interest piling. We called the credit card companies and negotiated away the debt for a fraction of the balance. The credit card companies had already gotten their money back - so they were willing to take some cash immediately instead of the whole balance.If she's not keeping up with the balances or hasn't paid much onto the cards might not be an option thought.Transfers work too - like others have mentioned.;jkaygmh;ewfnf3pd;b1wl5syk
Just throwing it in there if others haven’t there are balance transfer cards with 18-21 month 0% int periods. Look at the Discover IT or Citi Diamond cards.;jkb07f5;14tdkb;b1wl5syk
I’d suggest going with a personal loan. Yes she could aggressively pay off the debt if transferred to a 0% card but if there’s an emergency she’s going to use a credit card because she’ll have almost no savings. By getting a personal loan it prevents her from having more available credit to use and she can simultaneously build up her savings account to be able to cover 6 months of living expenses should there be some kind of emergency. Credit cards shouldn’t be used for emergencies or added into available spending when making a monthly budget that’s how she accumulated this debt.;jkb0xkl;cx5wvnjp;b1wl5syk
Having paid off $10000 of $12000 accrued by my husband in 5 months keep in mind she may have to take out multiple 0% transfer cards due to her income level and credit history. But it is still worth it to move all the debt to 0% interest - she’s likely paying at least $500 in interest alone every month. We made a spreadsheet to keep track of minimum payments due dates and how long the 0% rate lasted. And most importantly my husband has been doing the work to keep to our budget and on track to pay it all off. He’s doing great.;jkb2y3o;ca3uh;b1wl5syk
I did a personal loan for debt consolidation. My 2 CCs were 24% and 25% interest and the loan offered 11% interest. It was a 60 month loan but if I wasn't taking care of all the household bills I would have gone with a much shorter term. I didn't feel a 0% interest balance transfer was in the cards for me either bc of the very fixed amount I would be able to place toward my debt.;jkb46uw;gabivgs;b1wl5syk
First Tech Credit Union has 0% balance transfer and 0% balance transfer fee. If you don’t hit any of the credit union qualifications You can join by joining the financial fitness association for $8 well worth it for the balance transfers.;jkb46yl;16215u;b1wl5syk
If she can pay $600 a month after she does a balance transfer at 3% the fee would be $360 so take $12360 and divide that by 21 months…it’s like $589 a month.  But only if she can pay it off in 21 months.  If she can’t then they will attach the retroactive interest that would have been charged at the normal interest rate.  It can be done if she is disciplined.;jkb6o5j;dpzdo90i;b1wl5syk
"She may not qualify (I'm not certain what does) but give declaring bankruptcy a real look. My brother did it after years of trying to get out from under CC debt and he ended up super glad he finally did.It's tempting to think ""oh I should pay it off it's the responsible thing"" but it's a trap designed to suck her in.";jkb7pai;59bs9;b1wl5syk
Sounds like she can throw at least $1500 a month towards it. Does she have any savings too?;jkb8b9f;ceirb0dx;b1wl5syk
Someone might know better than me on this but my concern is that when you apply for a balance transfer card you are not applying for an amount you just get told what amount you get. So if she only gets approved for 4k then she’s still got 2 high interest cards and then a 3rd credit card payment even though its 0% interest. There’s no way she can pay that off in the allotted time since shes paying 2 other cards as well so then she starts racking up interest on that one as well. I think a personal loan might be a better fit. That way she’s applying for the amount she needs. Its not 0% but its lower than the cards and consolidates the debt.;jkb8q1o;i8u32;b1wl5syk
Yes doing a balance transfer with a 3% fee is a solid plan and will save her money *if she will pay off the debt before the promo period ends and if she will change her financial behavior.* Balance transfers are not to be used as bandaids. If she doesn't pay off the card in time interest will be applied retroactively to the entire balance and sometimes to the original balance. If she does that she will be in a worse position.She needs to get on a written budget that lists out all of her income expenses and debts. She has been spending beyond her means especially since she has no rent payment since you cover all of that. She needs to pay with cash from here on out. She should cut up credit cards so she can't use them. No more debt for her. To be clear she can keep the credit card accounts open so her credit score can be improved. Once her habits have improved then she can start using credit cards *if and only if she treats them like cash and pays off the balance immediately so there are no interest charges*.Also grown working adults need to pay rent. She needs to pay her share of rent and utilities. She has been splurging and needs to have a more realistic picture of how much it takes to live. You don't need to split the rent 50/50 right now if you don't want to but she needs to be making a significant contribution to rent/utilities.;jkb9eyh;5614qqqx;b1wl5syk
Get the longest term 0% APR card available...pay the 3% transfer fee one time..Trust me it's worth it..You will be pay over 3k in interest in 12 months if you don't do the balance transfer now. Don't waste time looking for a 0% balance transfer fee also those cards usually have less months on the 0% apr rate than those with 3% fee. Don't get a card with 5% transfer fee neither it's a rip off.make a plan to pay monthly.  The 3k+ in interest that she would have accrued over the year can now be put towards paying the amount owed.;jkbam4d;1xu3xsg3;b1wl5syk
I might look at something like a low interest loan from upgrade or something like that. It won't be 0% but if the math works out for savings a big plus is that it's not another credit card that more debt can be added to.If doing a 0% card transfer she needs to be super disciplined and not carry that card with her. If she gets in a pinch and purchases on it during this period she'll dig herself deeper.Just don't get too down about it. 12k sucks but it's not too bad compared to the amount of debt a lot of people are carrying.;jkbbx6p;jpiyja31;b1wl5syk
"Yes. Credit card loans are excellent low-interest money provided you make a calendar reminder to pay them off in full before the ""0%"" (not really because fees) period ends and follow your calendar reminders and pay them off. Sometimes margin loans are good often mortgages are good (not now) but in general this is the best source of cheap money for plebs I'm aware of. If anyone knows of a better source for *more* similarly cheap money or similar amounts of even cheaper money please educate me.";jkbchmu;9g7shfvwq;b1wl5syk
Whatever you do do not pay for her debt unless you get married at which point it is both of yours.;jkbd75b;1l3ex52;b1wl5syk
I will follow dave ramsay baby steps to take care of this situation. ❤️ watch some of his YouTube videos  you will be OK don't worry;jkbdkb9;hyi1lc;b1wl5syk
I got a loan to get rid of my cc debt. 4.9% interest my credit cards were at 27% so that helped significantly. I can pay it off in my own time.;jkbjo3c;nibyn54o;b1wl5syk
Tell her to get a personal loan pay off the credit cards and lower the limit on them. Then she should make out a budget and figure out why her expenses are outpacing her income and make a plan to rectify that.;jkbk2up;10qft1;b1wl5syk
> My suggestion to her was a balance transfer to a credit card that has 0% apr for 12 months and no transfer fees.You're still going to have monthly minimum payments. For instance if the monthly minimum is 5% and you have $5000 on the card then even though there's 0% interest you still have to pay $250 every month.;jkbleju;dshpa;b1wl5syk
In the same boat with my wife and me. One card is at $7000 and another $6000. She is a full time mom (newborn and 3 year old) so we’re living on one income for $4000 a month. We’re getting a refund of $4000 some time soon and put it all on the lower card. Like seeing the personal loan idea but open to others.;jkbo0g9;hych7v7y;b1wl5syk
The 3% transfer fee is well worth it if you have a plan for how to attack the balance.  The truth is you can keep moving it in this way and wipe it out.  Lots of these aren't great if you don't pay off within the window though.  It is important to know what you are walking into.;jkbolze;nibv7enf;b1wl5syk
Yeah I say go for it. Pay it off and once she’s done she can spend the same amount as the payment in cash.;jkbveoc;kx0xxbyg;b1wl5syk
There are tons of good advices down there how to pay off it but I didn’t see one. After she pay off the debt - change it to debit card. Use only what you have.But if she will need student loan it’ll be more predictable than just taking all on credit card and accumulating spendings to the interest.;jkbxhvp;p6o76;b1wl5syk
"I actually like one of the posters below who recommended getting a student loan - so can reduce the interest BIGTIME!  Your GF would need to enroll in a college course of course - but those are cheap at community colleges (sometimes free - but not sure if can get a student loan if $0 tuition.... maybe if required books?).. might need to go to class 1 night/week for 1st semester -- but LOTs of college courses can be interesting... heck maybe there is a finance one she can take to learn a bit more about managing money?Jjust make sure to register for a grad school course (so can take out bigger loan $20500max/year)  think she'd get tiny almost zip interstate's... no transfer fee b/c she'd use college loan to immediately pay-off the $17000 she owes..... and will have years to pay back - mine was $76/month for something like 20 years (\*don't remember exactly how many years b/c paid it off early - by 3rd year of $76/mo payments)Suggest she put the ($20500 - $17000) $3500 into a separate bank account for paying back the $20500. Also she should auto-deposit ""x"" amount each paycheck to this account -- and use it to pay-off the student loan. Still has to pay-off the money but the muuuuuuuch better interest rate - and muuuccch longer timeframe to pay off this debt.";jkbxs5r;ssr9adqk;b1wl5syk
Easiest way is to tap out all of her assets and credit lines bet it all on the Eagles -5 vs the Pats.;jkby6cg;d9i02kn0;b1wl5syk
Without a doubt transfer that as soon as she can.  Then double up on the payments if she can.Another option is to do some side work for a few months in order to speed up the pay down as well as selling things and reducing spending.Almost everyone can trim down the budget and $2200 before bills and no rent there's no reason that can't be hammered down very quickly.;jkbylmb;yjxwa;b1wl5syk
If you do the balance transfer then you have to also cut up the other cards and close the accounts or she’ll just ring them up again. Then whatever the credit limit is on the 0% APR card is drag it down to $1000 above the balance everytime you make a payment. When it is all paid off you can keep the card at $1000 or $2500 credit limit until mature spending habits are learned.;jkc4prv;4i2hxb1i;b1wl5syk
Tell her to look into donating plasma. Generally it takes about two hours per donation and you can make about $500 per month for four hours a week of your time.;jkci7j2;gseh1;b1wl5syk
I know you’re not asking for relationship advice but be very careful.. I was in a similar situation once before that ended horribly because I tried to play savior.. it’s a tough balance act to not overstep and to not be taken advantage of.I wish you both the best of luck.;jkckjfq;1c782oi7;b1wl5syk
All I ask is don't get married until she shows maturity with money and also prenup cough cough;jkclikm;16a3tz;b1wl5syk
This assumes she would qualify for a 0% card which is often reserved for higher credit scores. Most don’t have credit limits that high either. And opening a bunch of cards at the same time can really ding a score making it difficult to actually achieve what you’re trying to do.  Credit bureaus are persnickety. It’s very tough to build good credit but only takes a couple bad choices to destroy it. And those bad choices can haunt a person for a while making car loans mortgages and even car insurance more expensive. It’s very hard to change someone’s money habits this way without actual intervention. You aren’t looking for relationship advice but you have been warned. If you do end up making this debt plan work she needs to cut up her old cards and agree to not add any more debt. She needs to get a debit card and only spend money that she has not on credit that accumulates more interest. Otherwise you’ll be right back here in 3 years asking for more advice.Good luck OP.;jkco7rx;kwvxk4oc;b1wl5syk
Woow! I'm in the same boat as her. Following for related advice. I thought about transferring but I don't know where to start. I have good credit and I just want to consolidate debt. I wouldn't be able to pay it off in 12months so a ~24 month no interest term.;jkcoemz;t90x7ku5;b1wl5syk
A balance transfer card can be useful IF your girlfriend actually intends to pay it off. Most people are aware that credit card debt is TOXIC. However many people choose to borrow using the card anyways so that they can enjoy instant gratification. The balance transfer card could work well if after running the numbers your girlfriend can pay off the card within the 21 month period. The card will merely delay the problem if she isn't committed to it. If you choose to do the balance transfer card make sure to pair it up with a well-defined budget.;jkcq8zq;7bajrjpm;b1wl5syk
Anyone that gets that much cc debt will do it again and again and again. Unless intervention is had and learning is done getting her a 0% interest for 12 month balance transfer will turn that 12k debt into 20k debt.;jkcrbib;7lrwr;b1wl5syk
Welp she made the relationship decision easier at least. Better to get the gargantuan red flags up front eh?;jkbdzk7;4vtc9;4134t

That is both sad and simultaneously hilarious. Yoooo I got ten stacks in card debt honey! I wanna check out this shiny evil student load that will definitely kill my future if I let it.

*internally screams*;jkcg9m3;e0pqspx;4134t
I did this with a similar amount of debt as OP’s girlfriend. It was easier to pay off. I was also lucky because interest rates were much lower six years ago. It took me three years to pay off.;jkcjeby;64se7yu5;4134t
You know student loans are for student expenses right? Either way that’s fraud 😂;jkclre1;6fkm6uei;4134t
Yeah my quick math of getting it down to 0% apr for awhile would save her $100s monthly. I think mentally it would help her some too.;jk9qldw;b1wl5syk;15oha6
How do you find a place that will take a 12k balance transfer?;jkbdhmi;wc78v;15oha6
Agreed. I was helping her with her accounts last night and found roughly $5000 of the CC debt was her school tuition from when she was working part time all of 2022 which is when I realized she has put all of her living expenses essentially on that CC for 2022. She’s been paying 2 times the minimum payments to try and dig out but still hasn’t changed life style much. We will be having a more in-depth conversation this evening as I just found out last night.;jk9pusi;b1wl5syk;235tt45
Am I crazy? Mind your fucking business. No one asked you for financial mental health advice. All he wanted to know was if getting rid of this debt was a solid plan and this mfr pulls out the “how did she rack up the debt?” Guy mind your neck and answer the question or don’t.;jkcq8k7;9ifyn;235tt45
Okay thank you just wanted to confirm my thought process. Will be breaking down her monthly budget tonight but she should at minimum have access to $1100 a month to put towards debt. Interest has been killing her for sure. She has plans on taking OT starting next week which should get her an extra $180 for shift she takes.;jk9qe8h;b1wl5syk;dwj45
It’s usually a 3% transfer fee and it’s considerably lower than monthly payments at 17% and 21% (assuming she wouldn’t and couldn’t actually pay it all down 3-4 months).Even if she puts $2200/month she’ll take 6 months to pay it off and owe $652 in interest. If she puts it on a 0% apr card that’s $12k*3%=360. To break even using your method she would have to be making >$4000 in 3 months for interest amounts to be about $360.Go the 0% APR route.;jkcnmlj;27n5dcm;dwj45
Interesting! Are there any negative consequences of using one of these services? I’m not in a dire situation but would really like to get my debt under control especially my credit card debt (very similar to OPs situation but for myself) so I’m wondering if this might be a good solution for myself.;jkaztls;87nzhkrg;utybu
Same. Especially with the interest rates on credit cards it’s shockingly easy to accumulate this kind of debt over time. I transferred what I could to 0% apr (3% fee) credit card with the longest intro period (~18 months). It’s much easier to pay off debt quickly while not accruing interest.For me getting a higher income helped immensely and I’ve changed some of my spending habits. Had to put some of my cc debt on a personal loan from credit union which has a 9.5% interest rate but it’s better than 20%+.;jkacivn;mjedkhy1;xglhs
You should still use your credit card for day to day purchases. Just pay if off every month for the points and/or cashback;jkaemtd;ovrq2;xglhs
pretty standard for 0% offers. Issuer needs to make money somehow assuming debtor pays off the balance within the offer period—if not…ufff;jk9t2pt;l11uz;b1wl5syk
$800 total in her accounts. Almost 1/2 of the debt was college tuition she put on a CC and the rest was all her costs of living for 2022 when she worked part time.;jk9q24p;b1wl5syk;4f2ycuv7
2200 sounds spot on. Especially if there is 401k health dental being deductedEdit: 42000/12 = 3500 monthly before tax3500 * .67 = 2345 after tax (if tax rate is around 33%);jkahnyl;i26zy7o0;23mhm8a1
Completely agree. She was working part time for awhile while in school and put roughly $5000 of tuition on her credit card (I was unaware) she has opportunities for OT as an LPN so she spoke with her manager and got approval for 2 extra OT shifts a week which should help out a lot. Her health insurance it’s very pricey roughly $300 a month out of her checks. We had the discussion that transferring balance doesn’t solve the issue of spending habits too;jk9pcya;b1wl5syk;23mhm8a1
Not sure why you would take more home.You are at $2.5-2.9k before other withholdings and requirements just from income taxes.;jkatyc0;8bu7v0d;23mhm8a1
0.66*42000=27720 27720/12=23102/3 of posted salary is a good rule of thumb after taxes deductions etc etc. 2200/mo ses spot on for a 42k salary.;jkbl39p;p7jrn;23mhm8a1
Why does this have so many upvotes? Explain to me how $42k gross a year would translate to more than $2200/month net?;jkcioox;uny0pc93;23mhm8a1
You’d suggest that over a 3% transfer fee to a card with 0% apr for 12 months?;jk9xsek;b1wl5syk;9xo1w
I know my new card’s balance transfer limit wasn’t nearly high enough to transfer even a quarter of my 12K in debt way back when*^*lastweek;jkaumse;l0fzc;6jkbpy6d
Mine? Or hers?;jka3ku2;b1wl5syk;42vmi
Yeah I made a correction. Transfer fee is 3%. Quick math is she would “break even” in 1 month of interest free debt after the transfer fee.;jka68sf;b1wl5syk;4pblw16f
Groceries tuition therapy make up roughly 85% of the debt. Most of the rest is interest that grew in 2022 before she had a full time job.;jkaba4w;b1wl5syk;kdw1m
Agreed the only scenario the interest free card works is if she pays it off before the end of the period.;jkagvqr;b1wl5syk;11yw5q

So with a quick google that doesn’t seem to be thing in America or at least I can’t find it online and I’ve never heard of it. She’s also bene makimg 2X monthly payments since January so I think she’d have a hard time settling as she’s not delinquent and is pretty much a CC company dream customer currently.;jk9v0cr;b1wl5syk;irrs5

Just post this for Op and copying pasting for youFind a debt consolidation program. I was able to pull myself out of some 20 plus k loan through them. They charge you a small monthly fee and negotiate a lower rate with your creditors. Then they will give you a 36 months plan where you pay them one lump sum per month and they pay your creditors. It doesn’t hurt your credit at all.;jkbqc20;xq0fs;hych7v7y
Haha nope. We were discussing engagement but it’s on hold until she can demonstrate financial responsibility;jkcp9cn;b1wl5syk;16a3tz
Cards are already cut up. Budget is made. Her current credit score is 718 so it’s still pretty good for the time;jkcpgza;b1wl5syk;kwvxk4oc
There just has to be a self-destructive aspect to it when you’re getting out of the woods somehow by getting yet another line of credit to only spend yourself silly using that new credit. If I was married to a woman and I had to watch her do that to us first that would make me physically I’ll. Very ill. Second I’d immediately start interviewing divorce lawyers as fast as I could.;jkcmagy;g01qfok;16jd64

Pal just because Kevin Smith idiotically gambled his future on a credit card doesn’t mean you do. Putting a project like that on credit is truly reckless and unwise move today. Back in the mid to late 90s we had a thriving and robust independent movie business. Today it’s barely hanging on by a thread. And honestly it’s not about believing yourself. That’s a nonsense myth. It’s about seeing that you aren’t potentially hanging yourself by your sack.;jkccmse;g01qfok;kkcwy
Theres a reason why student debt is so... dehabilitating. Out of all my friends who got a student loan I think all of them spent 3/4th on a car or shopping spree.;jkcrr7m;7lrwr;6fkm6uei
"Totally get that however the pendulum swings the other way ""mentally"" too. The reason CC companies offer these deals is because the vast majority assume even more debt and dig a deeper hole before the 0% offer ends. Another big mistake is missing a payment during the free interest period and getting saddled with all of the interest.She is better off consolidating and feeling the pressure of paying off the debt as quickly as possible without getting over confident and splashing more money around with a 0% teaser rate imoAnother note: it is extremely difficult to change someone else's savings/spending habits and often the same scenario repeats itself again and again...Best of luck.";jka7si6;2c6wqy60;b1wl5syk
"Yeah but usually those are ""0% APR for 12 months and then we hit you with *retroactive interest* if the balance isn't paid off"" and that can land you in an even deeper hole. Careful with this route unless she can *realistically* pay the entire balance off in the promotional period (and that includes putting *no* new purchases on the CC).";jka22nr;6guk1;b1wl5syk
Also important to note in this situation she isn’t saving any money but instead saving herself time and effort burning cash even faster.;jka720r;am640zf;b1wl5syk
If she doesn't end up paying it off by the end of the terms it will charge back interest.;jkax6ta;t92qb;b1wl5syk
0% APR would be huge but start paying cash going forward.  Don’t have cash you can’t spend it.  She’s gotta figure out how her spending went off the rails;jkbkvn6;116w36;b1wl5syk
It was through a bank where I've had checking accounts for years and a relatively high income;jkbkbtq;15oha6;wc78v
An alternative would be a personal loan particularly those offered by credit unions can sometimes be easier to get approved for. Should offer a much lower rate a fixed monthly minimum no prepayment or transfer fees is pretty standard. Not as enticing as a 0% balance transfer but it will avoid the largest risk of having a third card to open up new charges and she would just have to show discipline in not using those cards again until the loan is fully paid off.;jk9qucj;235tt45;b1wl5syk
I have 2 crazy ideas and will probably get downvoted here:1. If she is still in school take out public college loans to pay for the credit card. With the new IDR and loan forgiveness programs she will probably do better than CC. And if she is interested in working for the government or non-profits you get PSLF forgiveness after 120 payments while working under those agencies. 2. Don't pay the credit cards and just let them go. $20k can still fuck with her long term so just let them go into judgement don't contact the CC companies and do not answer any calls. Her credit score will recover in 7 years.In either case she will need to figure out why she rack up those debt.;jkaws8r;87qcaifca;b1wl5syk
She should get the zero percent and use $1500 /monthly of her income to pay down the debt. $700 should be enough to cover groceries gas insurance and a few incidentals. In 10 months she'll be debt free.;jkcf9f8;i9qsb;b1wl5syk
Amazon is a KILLER in my house. My wife ran up a similar amount of debt and I didn’t really bring my head up from the sand to notice. It’s too freaking easy to just order it and have it at the house in 2 days.I’d suggest a good conversation about the danger of it;jkavot9;ft28p;b1wl5syk

I never said they shouldn't switch to a promotional interest deal.  I just pointed out to OP that there was a fee that they should factor in.  And I said that the fees are typically less than what they'd pay in interest otherwise.  Of course they should take on a transfer if the numbers work out.  That doesn't change the overall strategy of paying down the debt.;jkcr2jf;dwj45;27n5dcm
I helped my brother do this with a WellsFargo credit card. He was at 18% interest and with this program his monthly payment is down to 1%. So far no negatives just on a plan with a much lower interest rate and can cancel the payment plan if needed from what I remember. They are very informative and helpful when you call. https://www.takechargeamerica.org/;jkba5g2;juazpgdm;87nzhkrg

Good to know. Appreciate the direct response to the mathematical and deal structure of balance transfers.;jk9tmpj;b1wl5syk;l11uz
If she can't get a 0% interest (12-18 months typically) card then she should look into a personal loan with her bank or credit union.  Probably she should have done a low-interest personal loan for the college stuff but its understandable she may not have had a chance to consider it.;jka6edd;k4hqpnyj;b1wl5syk
With that much debt I wouldn't be contributing to a 401k or paying for a dental plan (have never seen a good dental plan anyway) if that's the case. She's paying a whole month's take-home pay each year in CC interest.;jkavn5r;23mhm8a1;i26zy7o0

Absolutely it would be very hard to payoff $12k in 12 months. Stretch it out to like 48-60 months if necessary at 9-10% interest and it might be reasonable enough. All depends on how much cash flow she has she can always payoff early. I've done similar a couple of times that I've overspent consolidated my credit cards into a $10-14k loan and took a few years to pay it back. Versus the 15%-21% on the credit cards you'd have to pay way more per month to ever get ahead of the interest on such a debt.;jk9yea6;9xo1w;b1wl5syk

Credit card companies make money off of you even if you never pay them a cent in fees or interest. They collect fees straight from the interchange and merchants. If the 0% card is paid off in full they still make the balance transfer fee and the fees off of any new transactions.;jkbf2nx;a1jnn;2c6wqy60
I’ve been doing 0% CC for many years now and I have lowered my debt this way.I have the CC set to autopay every month so I don’t have to worry about forgetting. And even if you forget just call them and they’ll let you make your payment without worry about interest.Once the 0% is up just transfer your balance to another CC. Setup autopay.And keep repeating until debt is gone.From my experience I like Capital One Discover and Credit Union cards because the minimum payments were higher. This definitely forced me to lower my debt quicker.  If you want a lower minimum payments go with Citi Chase and especially Wells Fargo. The Wells Fargo minimum payment was so low it took 4 months to pay off the 3% transfer fee.;jkc4te8;3v7pu;2c6wqy60
You are talking about differed interest and that isn't usually on balance transfer cards it's generally on purchases. That's the whole point of the 3-5% transfer fee. I'm saying it would be impossible but it certainly would be non-competitive. Most cards just take away your promotional rate after that time.;jkau7se;7wqioc95;6guk1
">but usually those are ""0% APR for 12 months and then we hit you with retroactive interest if the balance isn't paid off""Good lord how did this mythunderstanding get so many upvotes?  I expect better from this sub.  If it's ""0% APR"" (the vast majority of balance transfer offers) there's no ""retroactive interest"".  If it's ""no interest if paid in full"" or ""interest deferred"" then that's what carries the risk if you don't pay the balance in full this kind of thing is usually associated with in-store financing promotions.";jkaz3xt;tzbci58m;6guk1
Can’t open a balance transfer post without the mythical retroactive interest nonsense getting mentioned. That isn’t a thing on major credit cards anymore.;jkawp08;36wo9;6guk1
The card is 21 months 0% apr. In the event she’s not capable of paying off her debt in a reasonable 12 months roughly I don’t particularly care much about her repercussions of her actions because we would she’s fundamental differences which wouldn’t allow us to last as partners.;jka2qhe;b1wl5syk;6guk1
Some cards are like this but not most. Happened to me once and I assumed they were all like that. Not the case.;jkaljlw;dftvi;6guk1
If you make the same payments on either plan you'd end up at fundamentally the same place even if they retroactively apply the same amount of interest at the end of the period.  So at least the 0% plan would mean you have a *chance* of paying it off with absolutely no interest and/or could then transfer the (presumably much smaller) balance yet again towards the end.;jkazqm3;6vk2i;6guk1
"False. This applies ONLY to specifically labeled ""Deferred interest"" cards and individual purchases on store-branded cards.This is NOT true for a standard bank CC ""Balance Transfer"" card.";jkcs2xf;3136n;6guk1
Advantage of PL would be lower rate (not 0%) and it would likely be easier to be approved for and no temptations of a 3rd card is that summed up essentially? What’s your opinion in terms of if she only gets approved for $6000 balance transfer per say would it be wise to get a PL to cover the extra $6000 to get it at a lower rate also or just pay off the high interest card outright and then focus on the 0% transfer? Appreciate it.;jk9u50f;b1wl5syk;235tt45
Can she refinance then if it’s that kind of debt?;jka97yw;engasqp0;235tt45
i don’t know much about taking out a public college loan but i do know that letting the debts go to collections can be a risk. especially if a judgement (an award from the court saying money is owed) is entered against you which allows for an execution (a means of obtaining the funds involuntarily) to take place in order to satisfy the judgement. i’m not an attorney and nothing i say is legal advice however your best bet is to pay your debts before they get sent to collections and if they do get sent to collections request a payment arrangement prior to a judgement being entered or before any executions take place if unable to avoid a judgement.;jkb8crg;8vfsm863;87qcaifca
Same thought process also. She has access to plenty of OT starting in June which for each shift is $190 take home before her shift premiums/bonuses. She intends on 1 or 2 OT shifts a week. With that extra income she shouldn’t have much issue having the bulked knocked out before the end of 2023!;jkclird;b1wl5syk;i9qsb
"My wife and I struggled with this. Now we add things to our cart and have a monthly ""order day"" where we go through the cart and remove items we don't still need / want. It's been extremely helpful and also we get waaayy less cardboard waste.";jkay2ty;bmty4;ft28p
Don’t forget about how easy it is to spend on services. I think men on this sub often think their wives are wasting money on physical items without realizing how easy it is to spend thousands on hair (especially if it’s colored) skincare (facials Botox fillers) nails gym etc. Their husbands have literally no idea how much money is spent just to maintain their appearance.;jkb605d;3xv9svta;ft28p
No. About $700-$800 by my quick math. Other stuff was misc junk likely.;jkaapt2;b1wl5syk;dwj45
Appreciate the quick basic math breakdown!;jkcpcxb;b1wl5syk;27n5dcm
I know but I wanted you to know how the numbers worked. You actually said “to save the most money” which isn’t true. I wrote this for your reference too. I was actually helping one of my friends who was in a similar situation ($10k debt paying $300-$400 a month in interest. It’s insane!) So I just happen to know the fee transfer is a flat 3%.I forgot to say I used bankrate.com to calculate.;jkcrleq;27n5dcm;dwj45
How much is the monthly fee that DMP charges?;jkbcke1;hvy3m;juazpgdm
You could just limit your credit limit to 1-2 k and set it to auto pay every month. But I guess yeah if they don't even have that self control do what they can;jkat5b5;ovrq2;12084g
I've heard this advice before but that seems like trying to fix the symptom not the problem. Someone with no self control would just debit-away all their income every month without saving anything which is also no good long-term;jkbpkhk;gx1xv;12084g
Eh dental plans are usually only a couple $ for add on. Maybe $15/month at most with employer health and generally have 1.5-2k worth of coverage;jkbft0b;3m6n4;23mhm8a1
I agree.  Time to put the 401k on hold until she can pay off the debt.;jkawmxo;atu3t;23mhm8a1
For sure. I’m strongly against debt but I’d never suggest that! Recipe for disaster;jk9snqh;b1wl5syk;6kg0cp5i
Except in her case it doesn’t seem hard at all.  She has almost no bills and sounds like if she takes a few hours OT she can put at least 2k per month on debt.   That means she’s debt free on six months.;jk9zkcl;42zwk2ig;9xo1w
I might have not communicated properly. She will have roughly $1000-$1300 a month available for debt payment after all her bills and some money for fun. So there’s no reason she can’t pay this off in less than 12 months and if she can’t then I’m not really concerned past that point because then our lifestyles wouldn’t be compatible for a relationship.;jka00jw;b1wl5syk;9xo1w
Even if her $2200 take home was deducted to $1100 (ungodly generous) how is $12k in a year so unlikely? She doesn't pay for much of anything it seems.;jkavvh0;j795z;9xo1w
Take home is $2200 give or take $200 depending on shift premiums. Her monthly bills are roughly $700-$800. One card is $7000 at 21% apr. 2nd card is $5000 at 17% apr. Minimum monthly payments are similar around $140.;jka5nli;b1wl5syk;42vmi
Not positive for sure as she just told me last night. Quick glance at the accounts seemed like she’s been making double payments each month on the cards. But I’m unaware how much progress total or if she’s using them still. We are looking at those accounts tonight.;jkaklwt;b1wl5syk;71aeuzzfx
This is what I did when I payed off my CC debt. I couldn’t make the payment per month to pay it all off but I worked out a budget and paid what I could without accruing more debt. Then at the end I transferred the remaining again and then paid it all off during that next period. Both times I called and specifically made sure interest accrued on remaining balance only. Main difference was that second transfer was with a card I already currently had. I “paid off” that card and then two years later they offered me a 0% balance transfer.;jkc2yun;sli0xr1;1m3yhb9q
As long as the card has a 0% rate for BTs. You'll still usually pay a 3% fee for the transfer but then get 12-24 months to pay it off. However you usually have to remain in good standing. This at least means making the minimum payment and often also paying off new transactions for the month. I had some college CC debt that I barely made a dent in after a few years. Started doing the balance transfer game and paid it off in about a year and a half.;jkck1ub;t7g6h;1m3yhb9q
Yes. What is your point?;jkbln7o;tk5j2ia;a1jnn
I see those retroactive interest deals on store credit cards to buy new appliances not balance transfers. I've done the balance transfer thing before and didn't pay it off within the promotional period with no penalty.;jkb6s4c;61ofq;tzbci58m
21 months at 0% APR is fantastic.No argument from me around her needing some financial discipline and that being important hopefully this is a good life lesson for her.  That being said I would argue that it's financially irresponsible to pay off free money 9 months early.  I'd autopay [balance]/21 and use the remainder of cash flow to pay down any remaining high interest debt then build an emergency fund as fast as possible after that.;jkb0ex9;tzbci58m;b1wl5syk
That’s a pretty callous thing to say about anyone you are considering as a lifelong partner. “If she can’t pay off 12k of debt in 12 months screw her. I’m out.”Maybe that’s not how you intended it but maybe take a break from some of these Reddit comments and think about it as a person. I don’t know your relationship and have had both good and plenty of bad ones in my life. What you’re saying sounds like some of my bad ones though.Edit: There’s a difference between having financial problem with a SO and breaking up with someone because they can’t pay off their debt in a year. Especially when that debt is 28% of pre-tax income.;jkaif0d;5ruok;b1wl5syk
Using a credit card to scrape through college (assuming it was to scrape through college) is a pretty small mistake on the grand scheme of things.Now if she was using it for expensive break beach holidays and buying stacks of sports gear or whatever then that's a problem.Hope it works out!;jkcs915;3136n;b1wl5syk
What is her credit utilization rate? Even with good credit she may not get approved for another $12000 in unsecured credit if she is already pushing against her current limit. Especially since the extra $12000 would mean she would have access to unsecured credit that is more than 50% of her annual income. Has she actually applied for another card?;jka3qb1;17ju0y;b1wl5syk
Yeah basically. Even 6k would significantly cut down on the interest paid though you should just wipe out as much of the highest apr first. I think if she can show she can pay off the first two cards consistently without adding to the balance it would then be worth trying the 0% balance transfer. But if she falls back into building up debt it's just going to be more fuel for the fire;jk9w95w;235tt45;b1wl5syk
Having credit card account does not mean the card has to be in the wallet. Heck cut up the new card to prevent actual use. Then when things are all paid off and spending is under control call the card company and ask them to send another. Just say it is damaged and unusable. They will issue a new one at that time.;jkaiilf;upyu6;b1wl5syk
Technically if the bank allows it. It's usually not worth the risk as that likely means another hard-pull credit application.;jka9p17;235tt45;engasqp0
You are right op need to check state laws first. My wife (then gf) had a judgement against her (she co-sign a loan for her mom but it didn't get paid and her mom didn't tell her...) but we were in SC at the time and they can't garnish wages there.In any cases while her credit score had since recovered back to 780 it didn't matter since I already had house/cars before I met her.;jkbah3n;87qcaifca;8vfsm863
">Now we add things to our cart and have a monthly ""order day"" where we go through the cart and remove items we don't still need / want.That's a clever solution.";jkaznqu;7at92;bmty4
This is an interesting thing. Maybe I’ll try it out!;jkb2mj2;ft28p;bmty4
My wife is just a late night shopper and it’s overkill. But yes. Self care is *expensive* as all hell.;jkbdkz5;ft28p;3xv9svta
Sounds like she needs to figure out her expenses and tighten up the budget.;jkb7qgk;dwj45;b1wl5syk
How is what I said wrong?  You save the most money by prioritizing paying off the highest interest debts first.  That's basic math.  If one or both of the cards are transferred to a 0% card it doesn't change the overall principle.  It just means that they become the lowest priority debts in your list of payoffs because they're not accumulating interest anymore.  Having an option to put some of the debt onto a 0% card doesn't change the basic math of it all.  It just changes the variables that you're feeding into the calculations.;jkcsuar;dwj45;27n5dcm
Depends on the organization but usually around $30. That can bump up the price so it’s the equivalent of 2-3% but still much better than not doing DMP.;jkbrzwr;utybu;hvy3m
Disagree she should maintain at least here employer match (if there is one).;jkbdi6v;9r3le;atu3t
OP left out some details such as how much she spends on groceries her cellphone and insurance. I spend over $150/week on groceries and unless she's on a MVNO wouldn't be surprised if her cellphone bill is $100/month plus insurance could be $50-100/week. Adding it up 4x for groceries winds up at $600+$100+$200 that's $2200-900=$1300. She was spending something on the credit cards otherwise how did she wind up that far into debt? $1300 would allow for savings plus afford paying more than the minimum on a personal loan on that debt. Taking out a personal loan would wipe out the debt on the cards immediately and allow for better liquidity with lower monthly payments than wiping out her income on the debt.;jka0e7i;9xo1w;42zwk2ig
She should have some savings though too which is why I wouldn't use all the leftover cash on the debt. Plus she would need to want to curtail whatever spending lead to so much credit card debt. I am telling you this as someone who has overcome a similar situation having the cash in the bank is preferable to paying all of it on the debt each month.;jka0wn5;9xo1w;b1wl5syk
Yes but she may break up with you or you break up with her or her parent half a country away has a stroke and she needs to leave town for nine months - and suddenly she needs to pay her own housing and utility costs again can’t afford to pay off the card and is in bad shape.You Can do a zero balance card transfer.  Just make sure she knows the risks if she hasn’t though of them herself.  Would you guarantee in writing to let her continue to live with you rent free for 12 months under all circumstances?;jkaiexp;1gq34pte;b1wl5syk
It's better to have cash on hand than once again dip into the credit cards. Like I said in other comments I've been through similar situations and the only things that stopped it was having cash to cover expenses and consolidating it all into bite size payments vs trying to make more than $500/month payments. I think last loan I had was for $14k and payments were $364/month for 60 months. I paid it off like a year or two early by rounding up to $400 most months and sending a decent chunk whenever I came into money whether that be gifts or tax returns. Having the cash in my bank account made it harder to actually buy stuff except when I knew I could pay it off immediately or in a few months. It helped keep money in my checking account for unexpected things and reduced my reliance on credit cards.;jkaxmbi;9xo1w;j795z
if she's bringing in $2200 and spends $800 on billswhere's the other $1400/month going?;jka6rxo;42vmi;b1wl5syk
You said the reason they offer the deal is to collect interest when you don't pay them back. That's not true they offer the deal hoping you'll cut up your old cards and use there's instead;jkcadu4;a1jnn;tk5j2ia
Yup.  Never seen a balance transfer with deferred interest and never seen an in-store finance offer with 0% APR (unless you count new cars).Still best to plan on paying off the balance transfer before the 0% expires but no need for people to lie and say 0% APR is somehow not 0% APR or scare people away from using a useful tool.;jkbjagd;tzbci58m;61ofq
I disagree here.   It's too easy to overspend and not be the planner you need to be.  I also think the mental weight lifted is better than saving a few months at 4% APY in a bank savings account.;jkbrdq3;58tfp;tzbci58m
Finances are one of the biggest causes of divorce.  More people *should* screen for financial compatibility when dating.  There's nothing wrong with OP's attitude. It's no different than breaking up with someone because only one of you wants children have different religions or have totally different values.  These are exactly the kinds of reasons people should amicably end relationships before getting too serious.  None of those things mean the person you're breaking up with is bad or unworthy but long-term compatibility is about more than just liking being around someone and finding them attractive.;jkawpnp;xpzkx;5ruok
It’s 100% a deal breaker for me. I know my worth and I know I couldn’t be with someone who had fundamental financial differences from me. If it takes her 13 months that’s not the deal breaker for me. There’s absolutely 0 reason for someone that makes $2200 a month with less than $800 in monthly obligations can’t pay off $12000 if they’re being responsible. If it takes substantially longer than that then I’m being taken advantage of financially.;jkak6jy;b1wl5syk;5ruok
Are you kidding? Financial issues are one of THE biggest problems in relationships. I would 100% consider it a huge red flag in a partner if they committed to pay off their debts in a timely manner and then could not follow through. That would be an issue their entire relationship going forward.;jkbbe2e;32x17qo0;5ruok
OP never said gf was a potential life partner though?;jkav42a;597xh65b;5ruok
No. I had her hold off until I broke down everything math wise and we made a full budget down to every last cent. One card is about 40% utilization another is 90% utilization she has a 3rd card with nothing on it so I guess you could say that utilization is 0%. One cards limit is $11000 the other card limit is $7500 the card with no debt on it is $15000 limit.;jka553k;b1wl5syk;17ju0y
I’d be mind blown if she was offered that. I make 70K with a fully paid of home under a LLC 150K in brokerage no car payment no credit cards and was offered a 12K loan with 16% APR.  They told me without ever having any debt that to pay they couldn’t offer more as an unsecured loan.;jkbdwrb;a1reh;17ju0y
why are we concerned about another hard pull?;jkbqpmo;58tfp;235tt45
yeah op would definitely have to check state laws first and possibly discuss the matter with an attorney if it comes to that point. like i had said before i’m not an attorney but i do work in debt collections at a law firm & i have had a debt be sent to collections and had a suit filed against me. i paid the debt in full prior to a judgment being entered against me. however if i had been unable to pay anything & a judgment was entered and an execution was required to satisfy the judgment i would definitely prefer my wages be garnished over a bank levy.;jkbde5u;8vfsm863;87qcaifca
$800/mo for two people seems pretty high. Maybe this figure includes eating out? OP needs to look at receipts.;jkcqweo;99mtccu;dwj45
This is correct otherwise you leave money on the table;jkboiab;kfde7;9r3le
It’s certainly an option.  Assuming she can even qualify for the loan.  I was just guessing because like you said we didn’t get her expense numbers but I think most people with that little of bills can lean it down hard for 6 months and she would be debt free.;jka2i58;42zwk2ig;9xo1w
I agree. Even with roughly $1100 towards debt she would be able to put around $300-$400 in her checking account monthly along with the $800 she has available in her account currently. She also doesn’t have any surprises expenses since I handle everything else.;jka2gse;b1wl5syk;9xo1w
No because I’m not her parent. Her ENTIRE family lives less than 10 minutes away from us and they’d take her in tomorrow if she asked. So I’m not concerned;jkakcq2;b1wl5syk;1gq34pte
Her full time job started end of January. So she’s only had access to this income for roughly 4 months. Since then the debt has been going down with extra payments by her. Interest rate is just slowing down progress drastically. Debt incurred was roughly $5000 in college tuition $3000 was therapy for basically all of 2022. So the other $3000 is a misc of interest gained in 2022 and off and end things she purchased all of 2022 when she only had access to roughly $900 a month of income.;jkaagse;b1wl5syk;42vmi
If she can buckle down and pay off any remaining high interest debt ASAP build an emergency fund and still pay off the 0% balance in 12 months then great.  If not then rushing to pay off 0% interest debt that early without an emergency fund is a worse choice.Using the full term of the offer to come out on a better financial footing would be more financially responsible.  I know OP isn't asking for relationship advice but I would consider doing it this way a good thing not a relationship-ender.If the cause of the overspending is not addressed then that's a risk no matter what order she does things in.;jkcpjg9;tzbci58m;58tfp
OP I think this is wise. It sounds a bit callous but why sugarcoat? You are trying to help her in a sincere way it's up to her now. Getting entangled with financially irresponsible people is extremely stressful I can attest from personal experience.;jkaszwi;gdzkjzf5;b1wl5syk
I agree if you have fundamental financial differences you should not be together. Maybe you should show her all the comments in this post to make sure you’re on the same page.;jkb2j9j;5ruok;b1wl5syk
There's no advantage other than perhaps mental to paying off the debt in 13 months vs 20 if it's at 0% apy and the transfer fee was upfront. If there's gonna be red flags from this I don't think you'll have to wait a year to see them.;jkcn4iq;j7rnj;b1wl5syk
You don't generally date someone and call them your gf with the intent to end it in 3 years;jkaykop;14c6f4;597xh65b
Yeah so I don't think she will get approved for additional credit with attractive terms. But given her income and expenses she can easily retire this debt within 18 months. Or faster. If she throws $1500 per month at the 21% debt she would retire the debt in 6 months while paying $235.88 in total interest. The 6th month payment would only be $1235.Such an aggressive schedule may not be feasible. If she pays the minimum on the lower interest debt she would have $579 a month for other obligations. But the point is that the debt can be retired relatively quickly given her income and apparent expenses. She should be able to retire the debt while accruing less than $800 in total interest. Which is 6% of the outstanding debt. Which is lower than the rate you would get for a personal loan. So my advice is don't overthink this thing. Just keep the debt where it is and pay it down as quickly as possible.;jkaabvy;17ju0y;b1wl5syk
What company is the third card through? If your gf already has that third card with that much of a limit already open it might already offer a 0% balance transfer or even a repayment similar to a personal loan. Here's one example: [https://www.chase.com/personal/credit-cards/mychaseloan](https://www.chase.com/personal/credit-cards/mychaseloan);jka9y2r;235tt45;b1wl5syk
That's actually a really good sign that she didn't max them all out... Just got away from her then not compulsive behavior or something.;jkb7hmb;62jc5;b1wl5syk
> the card with no debt on it is $15000 limitSince she already has that card it might be worth calling that company and asking if they'll make her a good offer on a balance transfer. Tell them about that 21-month deal you're looking at and see if they'll match it or come close without the balance transfer fee.And if you do end up tranferring the balances of those other two cards no matter what you transfer them to make sure she cuts up those cards.;jkbw4sv;20m13;b1wl5syk
I was in a very similar situation and I did a balance transfer to a new card and whatever they didn't approve me for to an existing card paid both down as much as I could during those 12-18 months then got a personal loan and paid down the rest over maybe 2-3 years. Getting into debt is very easy when you're younger and don't make much. I did start to make more which helped and I've been debt free since so she can do it you just have to accept it'll be a 3-5 year process. Luckily it doesn't sound like she needs convincing.I made a spreadsheet where I tracked the principle and interest payments and dates so I had something to look forward to. I even paid it off three months early because it was so psychologically worth it to be done even if I had to cut into my savings.;jkbm22o;6uz49;b1wl5syk
The utilization as it pertains to a credit score is the total of all balances over the total available credit. So you’re looking at roughly $12k/33.5k. ~36%.Your credit score starts getting seriously penalized when it’s over 30% but it bounces back as soon as it’s under that threshold.Like others have said getting a low interest personal loan (from a credit union or bank!!) and transferring the debt to the loan is the best option.I personally don’t think anyone really needs more than two credit cards I would keep the best two (or the ones with the longest history of we’re talking about 5+ year differences) but at this point the key is to get the debt off the high interest line and make the other changes once you have a working plan for that.And just one more thing about personal loans vs. a credit card transfer dance. She will probably be able to get a loan to cover it as it is a different lower-risk class of debt for banks than credit cards. Loans also tend to have a fixed lower rate but the credit cards are all variable. It’s unlikely that she would pay either in 12 months and some 0% APRs end up retroactively charging interest on the original balance. The cost of interest is something you can calculate for both a loan and a credit card balance and running those numbers can be a good motivator to avoid using credit cards for this kind of debt in the future as well as paying it off more aggressively.If she has parents that would consider co-signing for a personal loan she should definitely be able to get a better arrangement than credit cards.;jkcko9i;ovqp;b1wl5syk
She should build up a little bit larger emergency fund before paying off the credit card but with the amount she’s save that should only take a month or two.;jkb28lc;5ruok;b1wl5syk

Basic gist - just divorced an abusive spouse. Financial physical emotional abuse and I got totally F*d in the divorce. We didn’t own property just debt and I got half. I’m left 20k in the hole CC/loan debt 40k IRS. I have a bunch of credit cards my ex racked up in my name and 3 loans. These end up about $1000 a month just to pay minimums. My car payment is $400. So that’s 1400 before any rent/utilities/food. My ex is on a payment plan with the IRS but if he goes to jail for trying to kill me that won’t get paid! I’m out of a job at the end of the month and not getting any calls so it might be McDonalds for a bit. Basically I can’t pay anything. My credit is tanking bc I’m paying everything late. I can’t scrape up any cash for a bankruptcy lawyer. I’ve literally sold everything I own. I live in an empty house with just a bed and soon I’m afraid i will be living in the car bc you can’t find housing under 1k here. I don’t know wtf to do. I can’t even make a payment arrangement with the credit cards bc I don’t know what (if anything) can pay. I don’t have anyone that can help me no family or friends. Can anyone give me like step by step advice on what to do?;13igzne;ot7mh;
Stop paying the cards immediately.  They'll go default and your credit will be trashed but who cares?  At some point when you get back on your feet you can settle it for $25-$40 cents on the dollar but to just try and make minimums will eat you alive.Obviously search for employment - as much as you can and try to make use of that car.  Drive uber Deliver food take people around on the way to your jobs.Near term that's what I'd suggest.  You are a long long way away from worrying about what your credit score is.;jk9stv3;vira4sxh;ot7mh
I'm so sorry for what you are experiencing OP. My mother is continuing to face a similar situation. For housing situations where are you located? Is there a women's shelter (or an abused women's org) you could contact? I used to work for a large DV org and we could step in in situations like this (even if you just want a court advocate to attend court with you for hearings etc.). A note on the IRS call them and ask to be assigned to a case manager (I'm not sure of the specific term) but it's basically a person at the IRS that is familiar with your case so you can call them to give updates etc so you don't have to explain your situation 500 times. The IRS can be shockingly understanding and work with you if you give them the information needed. I hope you are able to mediate that at least to get the IRS off your worry list. Hoping for the best for you OP. I am glad you are alive <3;jkad4ct;i2bo6x7h;ot7mh
Reach out to your community resources womens shelters 211 etc. Legal aid might be able to help you etc. Here's a link to a site that can get you started. There are a lot of free and low-cost help available you just have to track it all down: [https://www.womenslaw.org/find-help?reset-state=1](https://www.womenslaw.org/find-help?reset-state=1) I know it's a lot of information there but help is out there. Sadly your situation is all too common. While it's new and scary for you the people who work in these non-profits have seen it ALL before and really can help. Take all the assistance offered and don't be too proud to accept anything. We all need help now and then.;jka816g;d7g0w;ot7mh
Sounds like bankruptcy might be the right way to go for you. You'd be restarting from zero but is sounds like that's kinda what you need right now.;jkahnor;4dekl849;ot7mh
With the IRS did you know about it?  If not the IRS can help. Also the IRS doesn’t split it in half. It’s owed by both parties regardless of what your decree says.;jkag846;yabus;ot7mh
Hey - it's just money at the end of the day. You got out and that's the ONLY thing that matters. Your credit will bounce back and you'll make it out of this.  Don't worry about the cards for now.Do you have a domestic violence shelter near you? They can help you with housing and other resources in your area. They might even be able to help you navigate the financial situation.  That could be your first step to get some support.You got this one day at time!;jkb1v0t;16uejp;ot7mh
Sorry for all your troubles but there's hope. Get in touch with the consumer counseling near you. [Here's more info](https://clark.com/personal-finance-credit/national-foundation-for-credit-counseling-contact/). There is a nominal fee for the service but worth it. They might be able to help negotiate a lower balance due to the cc companies combine all your debt into a single monthly pymt plan that works for you help you make a budget and get you back on your feet. Hope this works for you and all the best for a brighter future.;jkatwrk;x7kz5;ot7mh
"Stop paying the cards.&#x200B;Look for a room rental. Sucks but roommates are better than no housing and splitting utilities will save you $$. &#x200B;Your second job right now is applying everywhere so hopefully your unemployment stint will be short.&#x200B;IRS will work with you.&#x200B;Highly recommend just working your little ass off and getting back on your feet ASAP. It's painful but as someone who has done two full time jobs to eliminate debt - it's nice to just rip the bandaid off instead of taking years and years and years to fix shit.";jkb4iuf;awkvlfm;ot7mh
first you need to eat pay rent and have transportation.  nothing gets paid til thats done. then list your debts smallest to largest first.  only pay your necessities and your smallest debt pay the minimums on the others.  once one is paid off knock out the next one. glad to help if you need more help id have to see your numbers though first.;jkagyi9;vfbz4nrk;ot7mh
Not paying off credit cards seems like good advice but in my head its a catch 22 with most rent places do credit checks! I hate saying this but its a vicious loop so hopefully you can find a rental that doesnt do credit checks.Downlad credit karma to check your debts to stay on top of phone notificatiions and credit cards. In addition download your credit reports at [Annualcreditreport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action)!;jk9yuen;1thqs3av;ot7mh
Call cc companies and explain your situation. Maybe they can work with you since you won’t be working soon.;jkagx60;14qpqr;ot7mh

If no one else has mentioned it please do call the IRS and see if you can apply for “Innocent Spouse Relief.” I don’t know what your situation is with the back taxes owed but my ex had a business and he spent every penny on restaurants and bars before I could pay the bills (or taxes) so we had a huge shared debt (community property state). After the divorce I was able to attain innocent spouse relief. It took so. Many. Calls. I took meticulous notes about every phone call and who I spoke to about what and when and eventually instead of nearly $100000 in tax debt I was able to pay off something like $5500. It was an enormous help in getting out from under the huge weight I felt. I also had consulted with a tax lawyer first who didn’t think I would qualify but I did all the work with the IRS myself and it all worked out to give me years of my life back. Definitely worth the time and effort but you have to stay on top of it. Don’t give up.;jkbn8ed;7xg7rmm7;ot7mh
Is $40k owed to the IRS the entire amount or shared?Is it the original amount?  Did your ex not file or claimed that he did?I've seen IRS debt knocked down a ton.  If the ex was making more money and was claiming to file when he didn't you can surely get some leeway from the IRS.;jka8z22;zirj3;ot7mh
Bankruptcy is a good option to think about.;jkahydx;n6pik41o;ot7mh
Bankruptcy. Find an attorney who will let you make payments. I had to do it several years ago and it was the relief I needed lest I ended up in a mental ward. My credit score was rebuilt to 750 within 6-7 years. Co-signers can help you in the interim for things that require a credit check. I’m 42/M and had to completely start over again but it’s way better than continuing to drown.;jkam7d3;vp3pzss9;ot7mh
If you send just $5.00 a month to creditors I believe it’s considered a good faith payment and they can’t default. That’s what my cousin did but I don’t know how legal it is.;jkbci9g;nwgvjobt;ot7mh
Have you considered a battered womens shelter? I've stayed at one before. It was a nice house and I had my own room. Usually it's for women who are about to leave an abuser. In some you can stay several months while coming up with a plan. Maybe that means getting a roommate a new job + a side gig etc. Sorry to hear what happened.;jkb4dkw;618zfyvy;ot7mh
Where we live our local library knows all the resources available such an non-profits that help with house payments ect. Maybe call your and see if anyone can help direct you in the right direction.;jkb5env;57jrf0u;ot7mh
I think there’s a credit service that’ll help you settle for a combined lessor amount and you could work with them on a feasible payment plan. Maybe you can go into bankruptcy but that means you have to rebuild your credit later and isn’t ideal. I’d call the IRS and ask for forbearance if possible or some credit plan based on your possible income. And most of all I can say from experience that this is a blessing in disguise. It’s the debt you had to pay to get out of that situation. I had to take on all the debt in my divorce to get him to divorce me…after 4 years of stalling and bs in custody courts. Sometimes you have to pay to get rid of an albatross. Sorry though you’re going through this.;jkb8ea7;ndg7lypg;ot7mh
I’d consider bankruptcy. Generally you only have to come up with the filing fee and the no look attorney fee is paid over the life of the plan. It will definitely ding your credit but there are a lot of people walking around that you would never guess had at one point filed for bankruptcy.I would also see if you have any free legal services near you. They may be willing to get involved. If you had a lawyer in the divorce it doesn’t sound like they did a good job. You may be able to have to judge reconsider.;jkbmmnl;4ef2eqtl;ot7mh
I don't have any real financial advice but my mom left my dad in a similar situation after 30 years of marriage. Between credit cards she took out in his name IRS debt and numerous other things he left the marriage almost 70k in debt in total. He was a wreck. What I will say is that after a handful of years he had his head back above water. It'll take time but just know it's possible to right the ship.I wouldn't make a single credit card payment. Your credit will be trash if you pay them and your credit will be trash if you don't. You aren't currently in a position to make any sort of meaningful payment arrangement. Default on the credit cards and worry about keeping your housing and vehicle in order. When you're in a better position you can revisit the credit cards and probably negotiate a payoff for 25% of what you actually owe.Good luck and don't give up.;jkbvxlh;c96ljyd;ot7mh
You’ve already gotten amazing advice here so I just wanna add to say: How proud I am of you. I left an abuser a few years ago too. It’s so hard and clearly you’re still going through a very hard time but it’s vital to leave them. I’m so so SO proud of you for having the strength and resolve to do this on your own. You’re stronger than you likely give yourself credit for. You survived that and you’re gonna survive this too <3;jkbz9c6;g1jszm9c;ot7mh
My ex was financially abusive and my finances improved significantly after separation and divorce despite living on my own causing a significant increase in my monthly costs. This is anecdotal but hoping the same improvement happens for you despite the tight situation you are in right now.;jkaizpb;a534wnsh;ot7mh

I hate to tell you this. You have to get rid of the Civic. Get something cheaper for now to reliably take you from point A to B. Save and seek advice from a good bankruptcy lawyer. Structure the CC debt and come to an agreement with the banks to settle somehow. Basically saying “look I can’t pay all this”. Contact the IRS and explain to them the situation. Hopefully they can work with you. Best of luck.;jkaek4m;hwz5m;ot7mh
sorry but how did you get in debt with the irs by that much?;jkasl60;zwtac;ot7mh
File bankruptcy that will get the creditors off of your back. You start with a fresh slate soon after your bankruptcy is discharged. [getting credit after bankruptcy](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/credit-cards/when-can-i-apply-for-a-credit-card-after-bankruptcy/);jkauarq;j28jiza3;ot7mh
Look for a job within biking reach. Might sound dumb but if you can bike to work you could get rid of your car and just use Uber/Lyft when needed. This could be a last resort but you can save 400 a month plus insurance/gas. Just a thought;jkb4zih;7i7r9mnx;ot7mh
Honestly kill the cards or see if you can consolidate them into one with a smaller payment. If they all get killed off it only stays on for 7 years and if you at mc d they can't even garnish your wages most of the time. Call the irs see about some kind of hardship plan;jkb51a4;avigo2rv;ot7mh
Can you rent out a room or two in the house you’re living in?;jkb6ard;awwn0sp3;ot7mh
If you are behind on your credit card debts remember it’s unsecured debt which means it’s not attached to anything.  You can call and ask to be put on a hardship program.  Tell them you went through a divorce/ no job etc and say you would like to either settle your account if you can do so or if not they will stop the usage ability on the card and you will get 0% financing so all your payments will go to principal and not interest.  Say the min is $100 now say you can’t do more than $25 and they usually will accept that until the debt is paid off.  They will cancel debt if you come to a settlement and then you will get a 1099 next year for your taxes and have to claim that as income… you need to contact the IRS and do the same pay something versus nothing.  Otherwise these creditors will then put you in collections and eventually will hire an attorney to collect the debt.  You will have court fees tacked on and then they wage garnish you.  If you have no job they will levy your bank accts.  Best thing is don’t get to that point…make a list of all your creditors and the balance due the normal payment due date and interest on the card.  If you’re paying $1000 now you will probably land at around $500 a month maybe less and this will allow you to start putting some money aside.  When you accumulate enough you can pay down with extra payments or just keep saving for emergency fund;jkb8aox;dpzdo90i;ot7mh

You may have tried this but submit your resume to temp agencies. It’s a good way to make quick money and it can often lead to a permanent role/an opportunity for higher pay and benefits once you get your foot in the door. It saved me a few times when i was having a hard time finding a regular full time job and can’t recommend it enough;jkbf1t7;1q1q6zoj;ot7mh
Are the CCs and loans your ex wracked up in your name actually cards/loans you applied for? Or did he commit identity theft to get them? If the latter you should talk to a lawyer about getting them gone. That’s illegal and you aren’t responsible for them. But if you opened the card/applied for the loan and he had access that’s another story. I would for sure stop paying the cards whatever the situation is. They’ll wait they’re unsecured debt and you’ll likely be able to get a lot of it forgiven later. I believe I saw another comment saying that you’ll have to pay tax on the forgiven amount and that is correct.Seriously though if your ex opened/took out those loans fraudulently that is illegal and you are not responsible for them.After that you want to make sure your basics are covered. Food utilities rent and transportation. In that order. Real cheap but filling food. Lots of veggies and ramen. Frozen pizzas for a treat. That kind of thing. If you have a friend who might want to move in and help bring down your rent amount I would be pursuing that.After that I would contact the IRS and get on a payment plan with them. I would clear that debt first as quickly as possible. They have a lot more power to garnish wages and come after you and it isn’t bankrupt-able.Depending on how much you owe on your car in total I would work hard to get that paid off too. If you’re not underwater on it I would consider selling it private party and buy a cheap car that’ll get you to and from work. That’ll free up the $400/mo from your payment. I am so sorry you’re having to deal with all this stress. I am super proud of you for getting free!! You can do this. And there is absolutely no shame in working at McDonald’s for a while between jobs. The worst of your situation is over. Now it’s picking up the pieces and getting to a clean slate. Your future is so bright!;jkbjuaa;h9u1ivt4;ot7mh
Don’t know where you are but try either a local law school (student clinics) or domestic violence resources to try to find a pro bono bankruptcy lawyer. You sound like a good candidate for their services.;jkbkz9u;9j7lb8r3;ot7mh
A few things. . .if you Uber/Lyft/Door Dash etc you can write off a portion of your car cost to the gov.  That will help on 2 fronts employment and getting more out of your car.  Create an “offer in compromise” with the IRS it’s a way to pay down your tax owed if you can’t afford it.  If your ex goes to jail this may help your offer with the IRS. You can also pay for a lawyer (if you wanted a tax atty) with any available credit left and if you are planning on defaulting oh well.  When you settle down the road it will wash and cost you less than the price right now.  Find employment asap and help supplement any income with a side hustle.  Know that you made the right decision and you are taking control of your life.  You are free you are strong and you can do this.  Things may seem overwhelming but this will be a blip on the screen 10 years from now.  Keep your head up  and get excited.  You are about to experience life and it’s beauty while knowing 100x more than you did before your last relationship.;jkbs5yt;391f6;ot7mh
As for the $40k to the IRS look into sending an “Offer in Compromise” which may allow you to settle the amount for considerable less. For the rest bankruptcy isn’t as bad as people make it out to be. For example you could buy a home just two years after. I have much sympathy for you as I am still recovering in all ways from an abusive relationship that “ended” in 2015. It never really ends when you share children with your abuser. Post-separation abuse is the worst. Hang in there.;jkbtzyu;4lufl;ot7mh
We were $30k in cc debt and late numerous times on making minimum payments. 90-day overdue payments on our mortgage tanked our credit to 530. It took 22 years and the force of will to stick to it but we are now 100% debt free have an 840 credit score $240k in equity in our house and a net worth closing in on $500k. You’ve got to think long term when deep in debt. Cut the cards up pay off the lowest balance first and go from there. We are living proof it can be done. You can too.;jkbv5ty;ej3uo;ot7mh
Do not try to settle debt. Just go see a bankruptcy lawyer. Stop paying. All debt will be wiped. Your credit will be great in about 2 years max. You can’t file bankruptcy again for another 10 years so you are not a risk. I was forced into bankruptcy after my divorce and 11 months later bought my own house. It was a great decision to file. My attempts to pay unsuccessfully were worse for my credit report and stick around for 10 years. Just rip the bandaid and file asap.;jkc6tjm;vkm19;ot7mh
Everyone has given you great advice but one thing I think worth mulling over is right now since you have no income you should qualify for a lot of government benefits — SNAP & state healthcare being the main two. Also not sure what your career is but healthcare is booming. There’s a huge labor shortage and it’s only expected to get worse. Now might actually be a good time to consider going to school for a degree. It doesn’t have to be a full time university but there are many short-term programs that can set you on a path to a better career.;jkcbwq6;dqrc4;ot7mh
Thank you the idea of not paying bills is pretty awful but a roof over my head is more important. I appreciate the advice. Should I contact the CC and let them know I won’t be paying? Or just ghost them?;jk9vpn0;ot7mh;vira4sxh
This. All of this. Who cares about a credit score when it comes to eating and shelter. Focus on paying rent food utilities and your car payment for transportation. Screw the cards. When you're broke best place to be is work. So just work you ass off. 2-3 jobs and side gigs.;jk9trdx;8serdx1y;vira4sxh
The only issue with this is when I was looking for apartments they wanted to run a credit check. Seeing that your score is currently dropping fast not sure if it tells them why but obviously dropping due to something not good. It's going to be hard to get someone willing to let them rent.;jkbbicx;14uanx;vira4sxh
Yup. I’m not the type to not pay off debt and I haven’t been in as dire straits as OP has but I’ve been close years ago. 100% I would not give two shits about revolving debt medical debt or anything unsecured. I’m paying my mortgage/rent first then food then car if needed then make sure I have enough money to find a job (clothes gas etc) then I’ll worry about unsecured debts… if I can.If you’re that boned you have nothing to lose anyway declare bankruptcy if needed after they tank your credit score anyway.;jkb1vqa;kbxbld21;vira4sxh
I don’t think that’ll work with the 40k irs debt though will it? I was under the impression that they would just garnish your wages.;jkboflv;iqwzh;vira4sxh
Strong advice. I had to consolidate my debt after finding out I was -$800/month after a pay decrease. My credit is at an all time low and it will be for at least three years. But it’s worth being humbled a little now and having temporary limitations to have a life with my fiancé later.;jkbv0p2;588wyt9k;vira4sxh
Can't stress this enough. Came back from deployment with creditors calling about $50K my ex had run up before we divorced (all of it was in work before I deployed so not some she left me sob story). I really didn't know how the game was played and ended up extending the process longer than it needed to be so pay attention to what you find on the subs wiki I learned a lot of it the hard way. Basically worked only in cash (no credit) for several years and slowly built my credit back up over the better part of a decade.Sometimes you just have to play the long game. OP you are not alone.;jkcr0bx;2oa9x;vira4sxh
I like the idea of leveraging the car but maintenance and gas for a driving related job could become another financial bomb.;jkcwrw6;8kwf2pfu;vira4sxh
Thank you so much. I’m in a small town so when I called my local shelter and housing resources I was told to get a job or move somewhere cheaper. I am working on seeing if I can rent a single room or a shared apt situation. Great info with the IRS thats very helpful and I have found them to be very understanding when you communicate. I hope the best for your mom as well that she is able to get back on her feet and be safe. Thank you.;jkaedyw;ot7mh;i2bo6x7h

Also don’t forget interest rates play a large factor in this method. Pay your higher interest rate debts off first and work your way down.;jkbon89;hftdz;vfbz4nrk

Thats the entire amount. He filed just kept claiming exempt to get bigger paychecks and then letting it snowball. We filed married joint so I may be able to talk to a tax attorney in the future. So far he’s got a repayment agreement but if he backs out I’ll have to work with IRS on it. Crazy dumb stuff.;jkacpbq;ot7mh;zirj3

I don’t know if I qualify but I’m in no position to turn anything down! I’ll look into it thank you;jkacu1j;ot7mh;cnwa3tj
This is atrocious advice. They don’t have a lump of cash to buy anything else they can’t afford the transaction costs their credit is tanking so they’ll get killed on any kind of financing. A couple hundred bucks for what should be reliable transportation for years is fine. The downside risk of some beater that suddenly needs cash to repair and puts their ability to get to their already limited job options is far too great.;jkaj86h;9oush7sm;hwz5m
Got a settlement and they told me to put aside money bc it would be taxed found out he spent the money that was supposed to go to IRS and then he claimed exempt on his withholdings for years to get bigger paychecks and let it snowball.;jkavt7u;ot7mh;zwtac
So I found myself in $20000 in credit card debt with no way to pay. I was pay check to pay check and barely making rent every month. I let the cards go and defaulted on them. I eventually got back on my feet and paid off the debt. I settled one card and $7000 was forgiven (I owed taxes on this amount as it’s considered income). I paid off $10000 to the IRS too. And guess what? I’m now back on my feet with my credit score over 700. It takes time but sometimes you have to bottom out and start over. I’m 37 if that matters.;jkaazjy;8hriykyzv;ot7mh
First step - find work.Second Dodge - Don't bother contacting the CC - waste of time they'll still put you in collections and all that endless spam from them.   Third Step - If anything load up the cards to pay for housing.   You can't even hope to get out of the debt without surviving this.Fourth Step - Bankruptcy lawyer to clear the CC debt eventually they'll get to garnishing wages and summons at your job.  So best to get your bankruptcy over with.Fifth Step - In general interest charged on IRS debt is low compared to everything else.  Still contacting the IRS is not a bad thing though might not help if you have no ability to pay anything...keep filing with them even when you can't pay.  Note - they IRS is relatively patient but does not forget (hence one of the last steps).   IRS will take payment plans you can defer for a decent amount of time with them as long as you don't try to tell them it's not ever being paid they seem to take that personal heh.   They charge interest on debt but my dad deferred this for a decade without being able to pay.Finale - Rebuilding credit is gas-cards car loans and store-cards...my mother post-divorce was back with a credit score of ~700 within 5yrs.  If you aren't making much you shouldn't be feeding the interest on these anyway.  Being poor everything around you costs more - laundrymats crappy cars break down high-interest cards...avoid as best you can living cheaply (honda/toyotas don't break often and cheaper to fix in-unit laundry...etc etc).Source parents divorced in 1996 (not as bad as yours) I lived in the back of a station wagon for 2yrs while attending highschool my dad was 70k in the hole with the irs and cc debt of 150k at the time...split between them.;jkapcb0;4b5cumwy;ot7mh
It really doesn't matter - just make sure in your divorce decree that you aren't jointly responsible and obligated per the terms to pay the debt.  Reneging on that would compound your problems.;jk9xsbf;vira4sxh;ot7mh
I ghosted CitiCard 15 years ago when I had a bad drug problem. $23k or so before it went to creditors. Thankfully they never got a judgement and by the time I got sober and back on my feet it was gone from my credit report.;jkaspjr;5100rsxc;ot7mh
It couldn't hurt to call them.  I did once when I found myself unable to pay the minimum one month.  I just asked the guy what I should do and we came up with a plan.  If they're not helpful just hang up.  Just don't agree to anything you can't manage.  Thank him and tell him you'll think about it and get back to them.;jkagux7;8i1ky;ot7mh
Seriously you can rebuild the credit. Once you get a stable situation look into setting up a basic secured credit card and just make sure you keep up those auto loan payments. If you have an opportunity to refinance or get a cheaper monthly payment somehow at a similar or lower interest rate do it. Focus on stability now. Rebuilding can come later. It’s not the doomsday some people make it seem to be.;jkb5aco;wnhde;ot7mh

There's a caveat to the advice given above. Depending on the job you are going to apply you may not get hired because of your financial background check. For example even a lower tier employment at a financial institution would check to make sure you don't have money problem. More and more private employers are incorporating your financial background to determine the hiring decision.;jkc0jyp;3hm7h765;ot7mh
Ghost;jkaucvm;j28jiza3;ot7mh
You should contact them and ask them for a lower payment/interest rate. Explain your situation and that I you simply can't afford to pay more than X. You need to be firm but polite. Most credit card companies will work with you because they want to collect something rather than nothing. They might close your accounts though which is fine.;jkba5a8;5614qqqx;ot7mh

Is the IRS debt yours or your ex? You could be eligible for innocent spouse relief if it isn’t truly your debt.  I had this happen with my ex husband while we were divorcing.  I was a stay at home parent with 0 income and he had an outstanding tax debt.  He filed our taxes jointly even though we were separated and ended up owing and not paying the IRS.  I had no clue until the IRS sent me a letter.  I called the IRS talked to them and they had me file for innocent spouse relief and I was off the hook for the debt.   He on the other hand owes the debt. The legal advocate at the domestic violence center helped me with getting a protective order against him and also filing bankruptcy for medical debt due to cancer and him using my information to secure lines of credit since he had power of attorney while I was sick.   I didn’t have much choice as I couldn’t fight the debt since he was my husband and I gave him power of attorney for the sake of our son.  All said and done he ran me into the ground over 300k and I was making 0 income so I don’t know how it happened. After bankruptcy my score was so bad filing dropped my score 4 points 🤣.  A year later I was in the mid 600’s 2 years after in the mid 700’s and now 9 years later I’m in the 800’s.  It’s not the worst thing you can do I promise you.  The one thing I remember my dad telling me after I admitted I had to file bankruptcy embarrassed AF was it’s better to leave with bad credit than leave in a body bag.  Credit can be rebuilt but your life is not replaceable.  It sounds like you are leaving a similar situation and I’m proud of you for getting out.  Everything in your life can be fixed I promise.  It will take time but it will happen.;jkbeuj8;ttjs9g4t;ot7mh

She also faced physical abuse which should remove her debt responsibility in court. Why is she being held liable for exactly half of the debt if she was a victim?;jkb96ou;8c634hma;u00mkvkn
Based on that first part you should not be made responsible by the court and law. Im not saying that you weren’t wronged but is it possible you aren’t giving the full picture here? The law should be siding with you based on what you have provided here.Now in the chance that the court has given you such a raw deal despite the hardship it may be beneficial to find an attorney and try to remove or reduce your part in the debts.Im glad you are trying to improve your situation.;jkb8ph8;8c634hma;ot7mh

From what I understand (and somebody please correct me if I am wrong) they buy bad credit from the bank for cents on the dollar and then go around using high-pressure tactics like the threat of litigation to collect on those debts. Not everyone will but just getting a few to pay them will result in profit.

I make $20 an hour 40 hours per week. I usually work a lot of overtime which is $30 an hour but recently that's slowed down. I do have a car loan which is 550 a month. I have two German shepherds so I have limited options.;13i9ax9;mjaii3op;
The vehicle payment is singlehandedly making you poor.;jk9f75e;4h2g8r2o;mjaii3op
Your car payment is \~1 week of your salary.That is going to make affording an apartment close to impossible on your salary.;jk9moyw;krlqj;mjaii3op
Impossible to say w/o seeing a full budget breakdown.  You make $20/hr and work some OT.  But you've said that's slowed down.  You have a $550 truck payment which.....is absurdly high given your income.  You don't list any of your other bills.  What do you spend on food on the dogs on truck insurance gas cell phone etc.?  Really hard to say what you can afford without knowing what your various expenses are.  Generally people say that rent shouldn't exceed 29% of your gross monthly income.  So for $20/hr that would be $3200/month gross and 29% would be $928.  So generally speaking you should try to be under $930/month for rent and utilities.  But again that still depends on the rest of your bills.;jk8qzga;dwj45;mjaii3op
Never include OT or bonuses in monthly budgeting.  Base everything off working a straight 40 hours.;jk9mx3o;9azca;mjaii3op
$550/mo car payment and not one but TWO relatively expensive to care for breed dogs that are on most places restricted breed list? I’m just gonna be blunt here you need to evaluate your life choices more when you’re making them. In the meantime you’re probably going to need roommates and a good bit of luck finding a place that will let your pups in there. No advice beyond that good luck and sorry if I sound like I’m being a jerk it’s just quite a predicament you’re in.;jk9kap8;azzp19lxo;mjaii3op
Stay where you are.You are dog poor and car poor.Plus you'd have to move into a house because no apartment landlord will let you have not 1 but 2 german shephards.;jk9t3vw;86lqk1m2;mjaii3op
Unless you and the dogs are living in that truck you can’t afford it.Sell the truck get something used at $12-15k that will drive in the snow. Also don’t factor in OT to what you can afford. As you said it went down greatly and you don’t get to decide when that happens. Budget without OT and use that as extra savings when you get it.;jk9awct;6xdv54qg;mjaii3op
As cheap as you can find that will let you have your dogs. Your car payment is super high for your income once you pay that off you can move in somewhere nicer.;jk8qtfg;6nq9nu3v;mjaii3op
I make $20/hr and live in an apartment with a roommate my half of rent is $850/month. I’m not poor but definitely don’t have as much leftover for saving as I would like. And I only have cats and no car payment. If I had big dogs and that large of a car payment I don’t think I could go over $600/month and even that would be pushing it.;jk9c0og;a654xbnm;mjaii3op
Get rid of that car payment. That’s way too high for your income.;jk94ktr;7me56v8z;mjaii3op
Need list of income and expenses before advice can be offered;jk8wa6d;33xfc92m;mjaii3op
Your car payment is what I was paying for student loans when I was making $20/hr.  Do not count overtime as that isn't guaranteed.  I struggled paying $900/month plus loan plus groceries and toiletries and gas. My rent included utilities and I don't have pets.  Unless you live in a lcol area I'd say you need to look into roommates.;jk9a2cn;tp3m8ptg;mjaii3op
Realistically $725 before utilities.  Basically 3x your take home income.  Hope you can find roommates who like dogs.You need to find a job that pays more.  Or you need to not have things you can't afford on your current income (like expensive pets and $30k cars).Also never factor in unguaranteed money into your expenses.  Overtime money is a bonus if you can get it but a bonus isn't something you should ever have to count on to survive.;jk9fab7;18w2yik2;mjaii3op

What do you make in a year / month with OT?;jk8mxrg;acepn;mjaii3op

Finding a landlord that will accept two German Shepherds in the unit might be you’re biggest hurdle.;jka73f4;ui32a;mjaii3op
We don't have enough info. 1. What is your total monthly income? 2. $550 is a lot for a car. Can you refinance and get a lower rate? If you can get it to $350 that would be useful.3. Are your German Shepherds healthy? What are their monthly bills?4. Where do you live?5. How much do you have saved?6. Do you have someone you're living with? 7.  How often do you keep your lights on? Use heat? AC? 8. Do you eat out a lot? 9. Do you travel? 10. Do you have any debt?;jk9mhyt;5xm2qsif;mjaii3op
Sell the car and get one you can immediately pay off in full.  The biggest financial mistake I’ve ever made is having that monthly car payment looming over my head.;jk9if4c;yieu6;mjaii3op
Well like other replies let me reiterate what you CAN NOT afford: your vehicle and your dogs.You're low income yet have a mid-high income car payment.;jk9ppvn;q35u1clx;mjaii3op
"It's good you get some overtime but it's important to not include it too much in budget planning. All it takes is for your boss to say ""we're over budget no more overtime."" And you'll have to rethink everything.";jk9qivv;wxmj7;mjaii3op
Based on what you're saying here I wouldn't have total budget more than half what you make. Personally speaking I've been around the same amount hourly in the past for awhile. It's really hard to enjoy any personal life or buy things you need when you're only banking 600 a month. You're gunna want food to go for long drives / have to. Gas isn't cheap and neither is the food you'll buy when you're out now. Assuming you're making around 2800-3k. Unless you find a real good deal with possibly a roommate. You probably can't realistically live on your own. Been there something will come up and it'll drain you savings. It'll take awhile to build them up. Personally I'd just stay at home even though it's not glamorous it's ultimately much less stressful financially.Edit: unless of course you have more than 10k in savings. Good emergency fund while saving somewhere around 1k a month;jk9a83f;thmnw;mjaii3op
Simple. Only calculate based on regular hours never calculate OT into it as it's unreliable. Then 1/4 to 1/3 of your gross or net income can be budgeted for rent. Of course having a car payment and pets decreases that amount per month.;jk9pa3n;7c1sfzjr;mjaii3op
Whoa. I make slightly less than you ($19.40/hr 40 hrs/week) in cheap cheap WI ($450 for my half of rent) and cannot fathom having that car payment. I DO max out my HSA contribute $100/month to my IRA and live on a strict budget. But that car payment is outrageous. After taxes and whatnot my take home income is $2197. Yours can’t be much higher without OT.;jk9ug4j;13o7uv;mjaii3op
At $20 per hour you gross about $41600 before overtime. Many financial experts recommend that your rent/housing payment should not exceed 25%-35% of your income so your target amount is about $1120 per month. With overtime you might be able to afford a bit more per month.That said your individual situation might be different. Rents are insane right now depending on where you live so $1200 might or might not be practical. You might also have more or fewer expenses than other folks that might suggest you can afford more or less rent per month.Your car loan is very high especially for your income. That would really make me want to cut my rent payment and/or other expenses.;jka71fj;5614qqqx;mjaii3op
That car payment is killing you. And I’m a dog person (and a fan of the big dogs specifically) but what made you think you can afford two large breed dogs that just so happen to be banned from most apartments? And I say that lovingly as a pittie owner;jka7a35;huu7ijc9;mjaii3op
Those are not all your expenses. Continue to think about what you spend every month and THEN figure out what you’ve got left for rent;jk9g9p5;66i7xing1;mjaii3op
Why would you spend that much on a car when you're on that salary and cant afford rent? Why? I don't understand why people do this. Should of gotten an older car. You care more about the appearance of success rather than actually attaining success.;jka62tq;ar20psil;mjaii3op
My rent on my first apartment in Florida was $290/month in 1988.   I went back there this year. Same building same unit new paint new appliances $2000/month.  I don’t think average salaries have 10xed since then.   It’s crazy what rents are.;jkah84i;a2ra03xs;mjaii3op
Hmm I’d say it comes down to what you personally value then once you nail that down what can you realistically do what’s actually feasible. Once you nail those two things down…then it’s a matter of finding the sweet spot inbetween. The car payment is a big one and I’m not against car payments at all so long it comfortably fits your budget.If I had to give a rough guess…1000-1200 at the max. Not sure what the rest of your budget looks like but that’s my guess.;jk8z69e;cy1r2xr1;mjaii3op
3200 a month.12% off the top to the feds: 3200 - 384.  Actual amount depends on how you filled out the w22800 a month. Minus car payment: 2800 - 5502250 a monthGas assuming once a week fill: 2250 - (75*4)1950 a month. Dog food: 1950 - 150 (depends on what you feed em)1800 a monthGotta eat. Groceries: 800- 100 * 41400 a month. Did you insure that beast eating all your income?: 400 - 1001300 a month left over for rent and whatever life might throw at you. Not much wiggle room to save.

Get rid of that car payment. That’s way too high for your income.;jk94lbc;7me56v8z;mjaii3op
I’d suggest no more than 25-30% of your take home pay. I’d also maybe work on getting a car with a smaller payment;jk9g48b;cqnw3isx;mjaii3op
Wow that vehicle payment is crazy high. My income is more than double yours but my car payment is less than half. Can you get into something less expensive?;jka2ps3;n6qgs;mjaii3op
Doing some back of the envelope and assuming your take home is ~$3200 / month and your car costs you all in $800 (including insurance gas etc) that gives you ~$2400 left over. Ideally you would spend ~$600 / month. Anything over $1000 will likely put you in a tight spot. That may be tough with two dogs but that’s the reality of your situation. How much are your other expenses? If they’re low then maybe you have a little wiggle room but I imagine it’s not cheap to feed two German shepherds. Whatever you do don’t factor overtime into your budget. Make sure your spending less than you make at 40 hrs / week and anytime you get overtime treat that as savings and set it aside.;jk8yuy2;b9pmp;mjaii3op

When my income was unstable I ran on 50% for all of rent utilities and anything reoccurring. I based it on worse possible monthly income.  It works but the numbers really suck sometimes but it allowed me money for food even though my living situation was garbage. What is important is you work with a landlord who is going to keep rent consistent and is somewhat honest with how much utilities are.  Sometimes if you call the utility company that can give you an estimate of the bill in that area. Which can help you figure out how much you'll be paying for utilities.... But to figure it out you need to know How much your spending now;jk9jzh5;2287ej9;mjaii3op
Work through a budget accounting for everything and you should be able to come up with something. A lot of people say 1/3 of your income but that sounds really high to me. I'd be trying to find a place to rent with a roommate at $5-600/mo if I were you.;jk9mtyc;v6wjss30;mjaii3op
Your vehicle payment is absolutely bonkers crazy. Why would you put that much towards a vehicle? I make similar pay to you and I have a car I paid off and at the time I only paid 118 a month for my loan. People spending that much money on a vehicle is beyond me so there’s your problem right there;jk9zziv;iawntay;mjaii3op

"You didnt give enough information to go specifically off expenses so I'll just point to the general rule of thumb which is to not exceed 30% of your gross pay on rent.  Usually you dont count income that is not guaranteed and you said ""usually"" you work overtime which makes it sound not guaranteed.  So 20 an hour 2080 hours a year (thats what full time is considered) would be  $41600 a year or $3466 a month.  30% of that is $1040.  So your rent shouldn't exceed $1040/mo according to the rule of thumb.";jka2ds3;54d01sls;mjaii3op
Listen to what others are saying here OP. Don’t want to sound pretentious but when I had a $500 car payment I was making double your salary and I still hated myself for it. Sold it in the advantage of the good market and bought myself something with cash for less than quarter of the price.Sell the truck. Buy an AWD SUV if you’re worried about snow. There are plenty of reliable options for under 15kI also have one GSD and I know how expensive these dogs can be. I can’t imagine having one let alone two while being limited to apartment living.;jkanuhf;eqi4s;mjaii3op
I'll say one thing always rule on base 40 hrs never account for bonus or ot. My last job I was getting 35+ a week at 85 an hr and quit for a lower paying job and less stress. When we did the budget before buying I based everything on base pay. The ot can disappear and you're left strapped or might move jobs.;jkao58r;a1jv0qj2;mjaii3op
Feel like people in the comments have already told you enough how bad that car debt is and isn't doing you any favors. You're also really young and in your first job there's room for growth here dude.Another commenter already suggested you should totally watch Caleb Hammer's videos on YouTube. He audits people's financial statements and their income. He gives ton of insight and advice to guests and its extremely eye opening. You are so young you can really set yourself up right by being more informed and financially literate.Here's a link to a video that I think is fairly applicable to you: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-htpyqia8w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-htpyqia8w)Good luck with everything!;jkb2sl1;10u0qr;mjaii3op
OP can you try to refinance your car loan? Can you get a longer loan that has a lower monthly payment? I'm also assuming concerned by how much you're probably paying in gas and insurance on this thing.If you go that route then pay whatever you can over the minimum each month but you won't have to pay $550/month.You still have more to pay on this car in your loan than most people are willing to borrow to begin with. This is a huge budget item for somebody that has other big expenses (taking care of two large dogs) and not that high of a salary (you're already admitting that by working overtime regularly).;jkb6ho3;krlqj;mjaii3op
That car payment though- Oof.So generally. You “should” allocate 1/3rd of your income to rent.I currently make less than you (and no opportunity for overtime) and yet my rent and utilities are around $800/mo.My parents have to sign as guarantor (because the complex requires at least 3x rent as income) so that sucks. But I’ll be getting a raise soon and finding a better job with my degree soon anyway but that’s all beside the point.Point is if you can reduce your car payment at all do that. Also if you can increase your income- do that too.Other than that yeah. You seem to have gotten yourself into a bad situation… and if you got yourself there then…;jkbhni4;dzyi8;mjaii3op
$550 for a car that you honestly can't afford is the issue. Why do people go broke to impress or fake it?;jkboqls;afdp5tc2;mjaii3op
Can you sell that car? I made 35 an hour and drove a less expensive car than that. I think with insurance it was still a lot less. I bought the car certified pre owned. Never spent more than 17500 on a car and only twice did I spend that much.;jk9x7c8;9q6ub66h;mjaii3op
I’m going to say this nicely- why the fuck is your car loan $550 month? I make almost the same as you but no overtime since I’m salaried and my car loan is $230. I can barely survive after all my bills are paid.;jkadair;vhmhe2c3;mjaii3op
Do you care more about what people think of you while you are driving around or where you live?  Because on your income you can't have both.;jk96xnk;dhhjz;mjaii3op
"Your info about income is vague as fuck but from what I can make out you have too much car and too much dog and it's going to make everything harder.Two german shepherds are going to make it really hard to rent in a lot of places. Every place I've ever rented that allowed pets had either a ""no dogs > weight limit"" or a ""no dangerous breeds"" rule (that rule always included pit bulls dobermans and german shepherds). I would lie to get around such rules but there's a limit to how much you can get away with. Like if you have a beagle/doberman mix that looks mostly like a beagle you can fudge it. If you have two blatantly purebred german shephards that weigh like 80 lbs each you're probably screwed unless you keep them somewhere else until after you're moved in. Depending on how much overtime you're netting consistently you could be ok with anywhere from 1000-1500 a month in rent but I would think on the low end of that. The dogs are going to make it a lot harder and more expensive to rent and they're going to dip into your income because dogs require food/medicine/etc.";jka86u5;11br2l;mjaii3op
I knew someone in your situation who had 2 big dogs.  His roommate found them a new 2-bedroom apartment and the owner didn't allow big dogs.  The manager told him to register the dogs as emotional support animals and the owner wouldn't legally be able to discriminate against that.  This was in CA.  I'm not sure about the laws in your state.  They got the apartment.;jkb3tkh;ubgdp4vm;mjaii3op
So before tax you’re taking home 2650 a month including your car payment. I would try to find something for 1300 so you can still afford basic necessities and be able to put more into savings. You shouldn’t factor in overtime just because it’s not always guaranteed.;jk8n3v9;ckiye;mjaii3op

Alrighty then mate rent calculation time innit. So you said you make $20 an hour working 40 hours that's $800 a week and roughly $3200 a month pre tax. Damn yeah that overtime would've boosted that up but shit happens yeah? At least the base pay ain't too shabby like some places out there.  The car loan is a bitch at $550 per month fo'sho. You probably wanna keep rent at like 30-40% of your income MAX to stay comfortable. Some may say lower but that's just too damn tight if ya ask me.  So if we say $1200 - $1500 a month for rent that leaves you with $1700 - $2000 for everything else. Better make sure the hound dogs eat cheap bruv dog food ain't no joke neither.  In short if you can find a decent 1 bedroom for $1200ish or maybe a room in a shared house for like $800-900 that'd be doable I reckon. But you gotta watch them utility costs like a goddamn hawk and try to save up a decent cushion incase shit hits the fan ya dig? Anything more and you'll be in a world of financial hurt.. hope this helps mate good luck with the poochies and the rent hunt! Lemme know if you got any other questions.;jk9cfnk;trcs11l7;mjaii3op
I would say given what I know you should not go above $300 month in rent only.    You are too stretched with the car loan and dogs.    Financially you are too limited.    Your income is such you could rent a room at a house ( possibly ) but would need to get rid of the dogs.I am assuming going car less is not an option.;jkah5zi;ff4w6zhq;mjaii3op
You don’t need a 550 car loan. What is it?! Get a Toyota;jkaxb7j;81m4imam;mjaii3op
Look into your local habitat for humanity. Not a quick fix but you could get a 0% mortgage. That’s what I did. Single adult no kids.;jk9z7ge;2hxnna;mjaii3op
How much money do you have left before the next paycheck comes in? How much of that money do you want to spend on higher rent?;jka1hho;x8n51;mjaii3op
Typically when you rent from somewhere they want you to make 2.5-3 times the monthly rent.Ex: rent is $1000/mo you'll need to earn a minimum of $2500-$3k before taxes.From there you have to budget out how much utilities/internet/car payment/insurance/pet expenses are going to be and add them all together.Does this amount exceed your monthly income? Or is it under? You also have to take into consideration if you want to put anything into savings.;jka4dae;643av;mjaii3op
I have a very situation to this and I'll say the key difference is my car payment is significantly lower than yours which is how I'm able to afford my $1350 rent per month. I'm also in a fairly smaller city that is somewhat reasonable cost of living living in the nicest apartment complex in tow.  My biggest suggestion to you would to deal with having a roommate or two and try to pay off your vehicle as quick as possible and take really good care of it to minimize future costly problems. Set a goal to have your debts paid off by a certain date and live below your means and then your living expenses can increase.;jka516t;5py8mwlz;mjaii3op
So you make $3200 a month before taxes and everything. -550 for you car note and -200 for insurance and -200 for the dogs -100 a week for food for you and -50 for gas. Leaves you with 2150  pre tax.  I am going to say keep rent under 1k.;jkakfdd;i96ae;mjaii3op
I’d say between $800-1000 per month MAXIMUM but that would be if you weren’t dropping 17% of your income on a car note which is definitely a major mistake IMO;jkakqe8;166st4;mjaii3op
I make more than twice that and have a car payment of half that. I'm assuming that isn't a 3-year loan either. You are 100% living above your means. Believe me I get it but you gotta fix it. Also if you are single the real question should be what is the cheapest place I could possibly live that allows pets is near work and is safe? How much implies  You wanna know your limit which is being poor forever talk.;jkaoxpz;7wqioc95;mjaii3op
with that income you need to get rid of that car and buy something cash you can afford or something way less;jkap6jh;5izzocop;mjaii3op
28% take home pay is the benchmark set in my area.So at $20/hr $3440/m you're looking at about $970 per month.;jkawour;14zds3;mjaii3op
I always shoot for rent to be between 25-28% of _net_ income. That is what you actually get in your bank account.28% of your monthly net income (estimated to be $2600 after tax) is $728 a month.;jkb29tq;6ab1b;mjaii3op
The rule of thumb is 30%.  Let's assume NO OT.$800/ week times 4.3 (the number of weeks in amonth) = $3440 mo thly gross.  Take-home is probably around $2400/mo. So your rent should be 800 - 1000 / month.  If you're in a high-rent area you probably need roommates.;jkb5ytz;b0viwyp8h;mjaii3op
There are more dog friendly states where it’s easier to find pet friendly apartments have you looked at Arizona? The rent there isn’t too far out of your range and most places I’ve looked at allowed for dogs.;jkbc9ti;2ieukuok;mjaii3op
Rule of thumb is your income should be 3x more than your rent.Since you're paying such a high car payment your monthly rent maximum is about $600.;jkbceai;m0kvc;mjaii3op
550 a month at 20 an hour is absurd. My wife and I make about 105k combined yearly and our 2 cars cost around that each month;jkbe20z;h7sgu;mjaii3op
With dogs like that sell the vehicle & get a small motorhome. I've been there done that. I lived in one so that i could keep my dog with me while making minimum wage.;jkbt8du;mjf0d;mjaii3op
Ditch the car. I know it’s to each their own but my wife and I have 2 cars total payment $254/m and I make about $75-80 an hour. I say this just to give you an idea and some perspective.;jkbtzb4;1yte23pt;mjaii3op
Do not count your overtime when figuring how much you can afford. Your car payment is way too high. What is the interest rate and when will it be paid off?;jkbxuw2;w48prq85;mjaii3op
Is the 550 including insurance or just the payment itself?;jkc0n4h;222iyr5t;mjaii3op
1) It’s really best you don’t include OT in your budgeting. You said yourself it’s now slowing down so it’s not a consistent number. Treat as extra not as income. 2) If you’re FT and have taxes taken out I assume you’re netting something around $2300-2400 per month off $3200 base pay. If you’re contracted you need to be setting aside about 25% of your check for taxes to be safe. 3) It’s hard to recommend an amount for rent without knowing the rest of your bills and spending. The general rule is to spend 1/3 of your take home pay or less so approximately $800 or less. You mentioned you live in a rural area - my rural hometown has entire 2-3 bedroom houses for rent for not much more than that. If you can find a roommate or two willing to put up with the dogs you could be okay and even build up a little safety net. Assuming you don’t have much other debt to handle and don’t expect to go on like a yearly trip to Disney World or anything. 4) If you’re determined or defaulting to live alone you need to sell your truck for a cheaper vehicle. The general rule with cars is also not to buy something more than about 1/3 of your income annually. So you overshot that by a A LOT and that thing is sucking in an entire week’s pay before you’ve even insured it or gassed it up. Used cars are overpriced right now for sure but you could pretty easily find something at about half or less that payment and free up a lot of room in your budget.;jkc5c7d;4euboi8k;mjaii3op
With that vehicle payment you don’t have that many options. If you are already living with your parents then you should do that until you pay off the car.Without the car payment you could probably afford a $1200 month rent. With the car payment it’s a $650 a month rent;jkc5vxu;6ylbhzps;mjaii3op
The general rule of thumb is to not spend more than 30% of your monthly income (not counting OT since that’s usually not consistent) on mortgage/rent.;jkcg6bd;15ws08;mjaii3op
A general rule for me is that your hard monthly costs (rent transportation insurance utilities phone etc) should be less than or equal to half your monthly income.;jkckvw0;10so2c;mjaii3op
$550 car payment!! I thought my $390 payment was a tad high for a $4k a month net salary in a LCOL area.Do you absolutely need the car for work?;jkcmz24;3136n;mjaii3op
I was looking at a 1/1 in a garden apartment for $1700. I decided on a 2/1 for $2200. It's a luxury. I also have a $550 car payment. But I drove my last car for 18 years. So that 60 month $550 payment over say 15 years is about $184.;jkcqlyq;8j7s7g6f;mjaii3op
We’ll that car and buy a beater then come back. Your payment is 550 and what you insurance is another 100-160 a month on top of that. That’s almost a week worth of pay. Shit is making you soooo poor and trapping you.;jkcsd5o;lhtjcafc;mjaii3op
I love dogs more than anything but I'll probably never get another one after the way things went with my last one.  A dog is a ticking financial timebomb especially with how inflated vet costs have become over the last 10 years.  Young people who rent really would be smart to avoid having pets at all when you're living paycheck to paycheck having a surprise vet bill can ruin you financially.  Plus you severely limit the apartments willing to rent to you.;jkczas2;uxyje0ud;mjaii3op
Bring in ~$3200 per month- should invest 25% ~$660- car -$550Leaves you with $1990- if you’re saving towards something you should aim to save another 20% of your income ideally in a HYSA- subtract the rest of your monthly expenses from that number and that’s what you can afford- if you have any outstanding debts ignore the above and pay that shit down as soon as possible - also get rid of that car payment if you can. Never pay up for a car unless you can afford it in cash. Please know that I am just your average simpleton providing information from Twitter/YouTube/Reddit.;jkd0byi;121o0u;mjaii3op
And the dogs. OP should cap his living costs at no more than $1200/month which likely means roomates which is difficult with dogs.OP has an inflated lifestyle for his income level.;jk9wsdz;7fmqp;4h2g8r2o
Sell that expensive/new car and grab something from 1998 or earlier. You’ll pay $500CDN/year on insurance ($20-35/month) and save literally thousands per year versus some crappy Hyundai Elantra or nasty crossover.;jkctiw0;4dh2d;4h2g8r2o
Sheesh $900? I live in Tampa and I haven’t seen a $900 apartment since the early 2000s living in Sweetwater (Miami). I have a friend in Sunrise who received a notice that her 1/1 went from 1540 to 1900. OP good luck you may need to find roommates in order to survive.;jk97qq6;kv02ps1x;dwj45
29%? Wow! Good to know. My rent is about 50% of what I make and it's a tiny $900 apartment. I guess at the lower levels of income the 29% can't really apply (nowhere rents for under $600 for example).;jk9su5r;nhhyo;dwj45
and your area of livingin my area you're not affording literally anything I think 1 bedrooms were MAYBE around that price here 20 years ago but the 2 bedroom I lived in then was already over $1200/mo and NOT in the nice area but that car note is absurdly high and I wouldn't move before doing something with that (unless that's car note AND insurance which could be age-related cost);jka1nsp;1rly7c63;dwj45
Had 2 dogs. Rent at the time was under $900 in 2020Even then I was still stressed because the other bills adds up to the rent and there was never enough fun money. If any;jkaw7y8;5u8q9mpd;dwj45
Thats genrally impossible in california and the rest of the U.S since gl finding rent under 1k for a studio bedroom apartment in the ghetto.;jkawdks;1362ff;dwj45
Agree with all of this and if I can just add one other  thing that matters… qualifying to rent. Most landlords require you make 3x the rent. That would put you around $1070. That’s not how much you SHOULD spend it’s the max you would even QUALIFY for. I wouldn’t feel comfortable advising even $900 for you. Has to be less. Or you need to sell your car and buy a 10 speed;jkb9sgg;8i776;dwj45
"As soon as you include it in the budget your boss has the talk about ""well we're slowing down a bit""....";jkakfhq;schqc7x2;9azca
I have a friend who lives like this. Two big dogs car payment of like $800 a month orders ubereats for most meals. In such bad debt and she complains she doesn't make enough money. She can barely make rent and has shit credit so she cant even move out of her overpriced house. I wouldn't be able to sleep at night if I had that kind of financial situation and am surprised when I read about people that live like this.;jk9t4ua;abs5m;azzp19lxo
Not even sure how many houses will allow two german shepherds;jkaxaw2;f602cc7;86lqk1m2
Unless you have a written note from your employer that it will continue;jkbdaip;tplv8x9;6xdv54qg
Let’s be honest tho.  I make a lot more than I used to and I’ve never felt like I’m saving and investing as much as I want to;jkbmqxc;sr8ht;a654xbnm
How do get rid of a high car payment without refinancing the car?;jkajonp;9fxt04zq;7me56v8z

And with 2 big dogs too.... Expensive;jk96xvh;txu25po4;pia13
I'm fascinated to know what the alternative is.;jk9mn9s;10d6ww;pia13
Sell the truck is the way to go. I don’t know where Op lives right now but 500 a month in rent is crazy cheap right now. OP should stay there as long as possible and get the rest of their finances in order.;jkacl1b;k9ulk;xezy4
"i'm guessing there's some bad credit in the mix too which jacks the auto loan payment through the roof; or straight tries to have what they think others think they should drive and it's just a poor decision.  also having two GS's is several hundred more a month each.  dog food has risen a ton in price lately i think 6 bags ago I was paying $91.  Now it's $107.  This time last year it was $82 - same stuff same quantity same store.  and that's each month for just a beagle.  time for a new car and no dogs in my thoughts.";jkagttj;12tp03;n6qgs
So homeless.  Dude asks where to live and you suggest…homeless;jkac2c4;r8khz;2i83wmdg
He was pretty clear about his income lol. He makes 20/hour full-time so ~40k. Works some overtime for some flexibility but you shouldn't base a budget on OT.;jkazsi2;cziab;11br2l
I disagree with this. He should be around $900 a month for rent. $800 left for everything else food utilities wants is nothing;jk922z1;4db0jil5;ckiye
Idk 1300 for rent and 550 for car leaves OP with $800 a month for everything else cutting it close;jk8xdfp;tji76lez;ckiye
$1300 is way too high.;jk97pmp;7nrzj61d;ckiye
$3200 a month PRE tax doesn’t leave OP with $1700-$2000 for everything else if they’re paying $1200-$1500 for rent - after taxes this is going to be a decent amount less than $3200 and that’s not including the $550 car loan.;jk9ehdn;d03qd;trcs11l7
For me a plan on any car is at least $600 a month and insurance id $400;jkazqk4;12qcvh;81m4imam
I made more than OP my first year out of school several years ago ($25/hr full time job $15/hr in a side gig) and my rent was ~$975/month. Money was tight with car payments car insurance and utilities. I had very little money to have fun with friends. But my car payment was $140/month. I think even that maximum is going to be a very tight budget until OP gets a meaningful raise. My salary bumped up 50% after a year so I was able to afford keeping my apartment actually warm the next winter lol.;jkb7fd2;krlqj;166st4
Yea but with a $550 car payment and expenses for the dogs  OP is looking at an extremely tight budget.And depending on where they live $970 might not be enough for reasonable housing to accommodate their dog.I have a small cat and I won't live in a studio or an apartment without decent windows because of her. My current apartment has a porch and a backyard which I felt was necessary for her quality of life. I pay more than I have to because of that. I can't imagine not needing at least this much for two dogs yet alone large active dogs.;jkb61mp;krlqj;14zds3
The only thing absurd is that this is literally the current *average* used car payment range as of Jan 2023https://www.bankrate.com/loans/auto-loans/average-monthly-car-payment/#payments;jkbs86b;3sn0enog;h7sgu
The dogs are a commitment though. Cannot get out of the dog as easily as out of a lease. They are living things.Cars are are expensive these days and yes $500 sounds a lot when you own your car and don't need to make payments. If it a new-ish car wit little maintenance cost I say screw it and keep it. Hard to find a reasonable vehicle under $18k these days and the interest is high. Better look at ways to increase the income. Save on eating out. Learn to cook. Drink beer with friends at their home or at a picnic. You can buy a 6-pack for the price of one beer at the bar. Get a Costco membership and use the $5 rotisserie chicken. Boil stock on the bones. Eat a lot of veggies.;jkaduje;12vf9q;7fmqp
Second on the dogs. Don't forget what will happen if the shepherds have a vet emergency? Wallet will be drained!;jkcbqv3;5arqkyyi;7fmqp
It’s incredibly common for people making $20 an hour to have roommates.;jk9ekhu;292rtjo;kv02ps1x
Oh yeah 20/hr is still firmly in 'has 3 roomates' territory. But op also has a dog good fucking luck.;jk9orpp;2i83wmdg;kv02ps1x
For sure.  Without knowing where OP lives $930 may not be attainable w/o roommates.  And that's only going off of their base income.  They talked about OT but it being less than it used to be.  If they were working 10 hours of OT a week that would probably change things a bit.;jk987c3;dwj45;kv02ps1x
Also I doubt that $1900/month 1 bedroom allows for the resident to have two German Shepherds.;jk9cccn;100jybt;kv02ps1x
It also depends on your location. I live in a small city in Illinois and rent can often be found below 900 especially with roommates. I only pay 400 and most people I know pay less than 700. My sister and her boyfriend live in a two story house in Missouri and they pay something in the 300 range each.;jk9o168;c7cr56b7;kv02ps1x
My old one bedroom in Tampa. I don’t live there. It’s at $1400 with washer and dryer. The two bedrooms are at $1700.;jka3pu7;xcjxu;kv02ps1x
I rent out a 3 bedroom condo with garage to someone in Iowa for $804/mo the difference across our country is wild.;jka48fg;5fd4v1w8;kv02ps1x
If a person can't find an apartment for thier budget then they need to find a room mate. Living by yourself and being self sufficient is a luxury.;jka036r;t8eer;kv02ps1x
rent in my area for a one-person apartment is around $700. with 3 roommates its $300-400.;jk9ayrn;11o44t;kv02ps1x
Yikes! 900 in Tampa you can almost afford to live in my shed in Saint Pete… you need a roommate or two hands down Can you move outside the city?;jkbet30;5pyfsjix;kv02ps1x
Ugh I used to rent an amazing 3/1 house in Seminole Heights for $850 between 2010-2014. Not anymore. Can’t believe how much Tampa has changed.;jkbkodf;3r2k7;kv02ps1x
It's just a classic rule of thumb.  It always comes down to individual budget.  And the more somebody makes the less the percentages matter.  Somebody who makes $20k a month can probably afford to spend 50% on rent and still easily afford things.  Somebody making $2000 a month probably not so much.;jk9talx;dwj45;nhhyo
Problem is if you look at apartments many list making 3x the rent amount net monthly is a requirement to be considered.;jka184k;5tmiwe5g;nhhyo
It does still apply it’s saying you need a roommate because living the way you’re living isn’t sustainable long term.;jk9z4oe;2wiug6dg;nhhyo
I wouldn’t say nowhere. I know several apartments in the Houston area with 1bds <$600. Hell I know a couple <$500;jkatxz1;55gghbbr;nhhyo
Where you live is a huge factor. Where I live you can easily get 2 bedroom apartments in good parts of the town for under $930/month.;jka81bn;dwj45;1rly7c63
"Yeah I think we all do and if you don't then you're that friend lol I'm the same way you are now I couldn't sleep with that situation but I used to be less like that and more impulsive to a slightly lesser extent than OP in my 20s but thankfully have grown wiser in my 30s.I mean like I get the frustration you have a certain life that you want to live but it's just not always within financial reach at the time and it can be at some point but most people don't want to wait till they get to that point. If she was making 120k/year with a paid off house and you want an 800 dollar car payment and two expensive dogs then by all means but it all comes back to living within your means and in this case here dogs and cars are not easy things to just change your mind on and ""cut back"" on. You got em now you're comitted so your only option is make more money which... isn't always super easy for everybody.It's a predicament.";jk9vp0l;azzp19lxo;abs5m
$800 a month for a car is a crap ton of money. Also Uber eats is unbelievably expensive. Learn to cook. You will be healthier save time (yes save time!) and spend less money. Start cooking simple nothing difficult to begin with. Understand the basics of techniques first and why things are cooked the way they are cooked.Hell maybe you can even make some cash on the side selling packed lunches and dinners to your friends. Everyone will win - friends will save on restaurant and delivery you get some side income. 85% of the cost of restaurant food are rent compensation profit and taxes.;jkaek9c;12vf9q;abs5m
I had a rental unit ruined by one of my ex-tenants 2 large dogs. Had to spend $500ish to get it cleaned. Never again.;jkb1xt0;h6vk7;f602cc7
I found a rental house on 0.8 acres for $2000/mo in a place where a 2bd apartment the same size is $3000/mo. Landlord doesn't have ANY pet policy. My two dogs love it here.It's out there you just have to find the gems.;jkd00dp;50s1iyw6;f602cc7
Sell it and downgrade.  $550 a month at $20 an hour is bananas;jkass0n;9tv6z;9fxt04zq
Get a new car;jkakh5p;j26hg;9fxt04zq
If the car is worth more than what's left on your loan you profit by selling it. Otherwise you'll owe something on it and that can be rolled into the new car's cost.I think the people here telling OP to get rid of the car are thinking wistfully. Interest rates are pretty high now and I'm willing to bet OP's loan is currently worth less than its trade-in value. So if they go for say a $10k car while still owing on their current car the payment wouldn't reduce by more than like $100-150 best case scenario.;jkarh7o;7edcbmy9;9fxt04zq
Your car payment is too high which might make rent difficult. What kind of car is it? What’s the payoff and what’s the value ?;jk8nm4m;acepn;mjaii3op
Doesn’t matter if it’s a truck. You bought a vehicle that cost almost what you bring home in a year. If you can break even on it I would sell and get some that’s more affordable in the 200-300 range;jk91w1k;4db0jil5;mjaii3op
You shouldn’t have that vehicle. Your car should be like 30-40% of your annual income. So like $10-15k;jk8w85l;14nn48;mjaii3op
Homelessness;jka7vb4;37bbnevs;10d6ww

The 2650 has the car included so it would be 1350 a month for other expensive;jk9zxxd;ckiye;tji76lez

Many 90’s cars sold at a good price these days.;jkcl5vy;14otjz;12vf9q

Yeah $20 an hour with 40 hours a week is not enough to live on your own in most cities in today's economy;jk9s490;9ssy2;292rtjo
For sure! I know people making more than that and still roommate. It’s just a shame that people cannot afford to have their own apartments these days. Rent is unreasonably high.;jkaeq9n;kv02ps1x;292rtjo
A lot of people see the truck as the biggest cost that would make renting difficult but the two dogs are where I see OP really having a hard time making this work.OP can find an apartment with a roommate or two within the recommended 29% of their income but the two German Shepherds will make it very very difficult to find a rental that would allow them. And if they did it would certainly come with a very large and non-refundable pet deposit fee per dog. German Shepherds if pure bred are also expensive to own. They require regular vet visits are prone to health issues like hip dysplasia that are expensive to treat and often require specialty diets that can cost a fortune.;jka7be5;ebcsolva;2i83wmdg
Two dogs by their count. That's a lot of expenditure when considering the car payment as well. Op you may need to think through your priorities in terms of what you may want to give up if roommates are not an option for you.;jkabvbd;6htpeuh2;2i83wmdg

You definitely don’t save time cooking over using a delivery service. The active time while ordering food is counted in seconds.;jkaz59p;dnecd;12vf9q
So roll negative equity into another vehicle?They aren't getting rid of the debt or payment. That will follow them into their next car.;jkd085j;50s1iyw6;9tv6z
Explain.He rolls his thousands possbile five figures of negative equity into the next loan on a cheaper car.Now he has a large payment still and a worse car.You can't just escape a car note unless you're willing to eat a huge multi-thousand dollar loss.This  doesn't put him ahead.;jkd0jis;50s1iyw6;j26hg
You’re fairly right based on my experience. I very recently co-signed an auto-loan for my 21 year old kid.  60k mile 2012 car it’s under $200 a month payment. Insurance is ~800 every six months.;jkblr7h;10y720;7edcbmy9
>If the car is worth more than what's left on your loanI can remember two years during a global supply chain disruption due to a deadly pandemic that this was possible. The other many decades on this earth? this is a pipe dream.He's daily driving a truck it's not a collectors item. on a $550 payment he's not ahead on the loan.;jkd0ecy;50s1iyw6;7edcbmy9
I'd guess it's more than his yearly take-home. He said $27k left to pay it off.;jk9jh98;x4pvc;4db0jil5
Cars also depreciate over time. I agree $200-300 range is good for his income. I make the same as him and my car loan is $230/ month.;jkadwaz;vhmhe2c3;4db0jil5
A car that is 30-40% of your annual income sounds insanely high.  How did you come up with this number?;jk8yh60;cg6ee;14nn48
I heard car related expenses should be less than 10% of your gross income. Maybe 15% if you need to push it.;jk90vnt;s14de9u;14nn48
I live in a particularly rural area. This winter was pretty rough so I panicked and bought a truck so I could continue to be able to go to work. The gas mileage is awful but I was still able to make it to work. I feel like I am financially dumb when it comes to certain things.;jk947ha;mjaii3op;14nn48
Ok I thought you were estimating his take home pay. It doesn’t really help to do before tax calculations because he won’t have $1350 for other expenses he will have significantly less ( probably close to about $800 as I originally stated ) after taxes. $800 a month for food possibly utilities car insurance ( if that wasn’t included in the $550 ) phone food dog care gas and whatever else OP needs doesn’t really work. Not to mention even if they were able to scrape by it would leave nothing for saving so one major thing happens and they’re screwed or in debt;jka0z72;tji76lez;ckiye
I make 3200/month net and i would never want a car payment over 300 per month. Luckily i work from home and my 95 grand cherokee only has 150k miles on it. I should be able to get a year or two more out of it.;jkb0rj9;p3j2k;schqc7x2
If you make the avocado toast yourself? Eat as much as you want. Takes 3 minutes to prepare. Why should I pay the restaurant overhead for something so simple!?;jkb4hiz;12vf9q;schqc7x2
I make twice as much as well and wouldn’t consider a 500 dollar monthly payment. I say screw it and sell it lol;jkbvhr8;55ymkoos;schqc7x2
You're not going to find a beater for less than 5k and it will last another year no issues.;jkcbsap;5arqkyyi;schqc7x2
Been crunching my wife's and I's finances and are at the same conclusion. The only way we're buying a vehicle comfortably is if we dont have debt payments and we keep the cost under $30000 ( which is about $550 a month for a 60 month loan). I made 80k and she makes 40k.;jkbqtz4;8568t;schqc7x2
My household makes way more than this has zero car payments a (relatively cheap compared to rent) mortgage no other debts and we'd still never even consider that car payment.;jkbszq2;17mcbg19;schqc7x2
I own my own house have a 420 a month boat payment own 5 cars only reason I’m broke is bc I buy snap on tools when I’m not even a mechanic just like high quality things. Boat payment is only that high bc I don’t feel like paying double due to ridiculous interest rates. Don’t even have a full pay check into the daily unless you wish to count oil changes and and gasoline. Also have a Rottweiler and buy purina pro plan dog food.;jkcw2qh;mq0lfpn4;schqc7x2
"Depending on the area you live in ""beater cars"" aren't even a few grand. I was looking for a car before I ended up buying new and beat up Hondas Toyotas Kias Chevy's with over 150k miles we're going for 15k. This is not reasonable with the maintenance costs and it's more worth just buying new.  I understand some areas may be different but I looked within 100 miles radius of me and found practically nothing for reasonable used cars.";jkcvv5e;hyocn;schqc7x2
The problem is the initial payment. Then depending on area a 7-10k car might have 100000 miles on it;jkau3cz;pvbb5;5jumkz8
"""How much rent can I afford?"" ""Quite a bit in the 90's!""My first apartment in 2010 was $360/month.";jkac574;e4nwu;9ssy2
They’d get by alright where I’m at. Where I live in Ohio you can still find apartments for 550. And according to a graph I found online 54% of the rent  prices ranged from $700- $1000. I make around 15 and average around almost 40 hours at my job. Im currently looking at places to move too.;jkbyvbx;7ja9g8dr;9ssy2
I pay $500 a month for rent.;jka8dxo;mjaii3op;ebcsolva
That's why I didn't include any OT in the guestimate numbers I threw out there.  But it's still worth asking OP how much OT they are typically given and what the situation with it is.;jk9n0px;dwj45;dprs1
Georgia. Anywhere that isn't Atlanta Savannah or Athens is gonna have rent in this range at least in the places I've stayed. I've mostly been in college towns with populations around 50k tho.;jk9l2fg;11o44t;zvlb0
right? I havent seen rent this cheap since I was 21 im now 40....I round rock near austin we got a nice 3 bedroom 2 bath for 900$ a month back then. Now the same apartment is over 2k.;jk9l0gr;c7z15;zvlb0
The smaller cities in Illinois/not in the Chicago metro float around that too. Think college towns like Springfield Champaign-Urbana Carbondale plus other places like Bloomington-Normal (State Farm);jkbq1nj;15y9af6k;zvlb0
OK true you are free to do something else in that time. It comes in hay when you are working on something actively.On the other hand if you are sitting home and chilling you can just as well do something fun and not wait for the food. I can cook something tasty in less time that it takes restaurant to cook and driver to pick the food up and deliver so the decision to effect time is much faster. I am a cheapskate so I started driving to pick up takeout. Also ordering with the restaurant directly to cut as many middle men as possible.;jkb482y;12vf9q;dnecd
I don't know where he got 30-40% but in OP's case that's 10-15K which is a decent price for a used car.  And yeah someone making around 100k getting a 30-40K new car sounds about typical even if it may not be the most financially prudent.;jk91n37;dytqc;cg6ee
How is that insanely high? If a person making 70k a year drives a 21k car do you think they are insanely overspending on their car?;jk9w7rk;4eqd40bh;cg6ee
A few years ago yeah but lately everything is ridiculously overpriced with nearly 10 year loans. You can't even get anything for MSRP right now unless it's a few years old (or a Tesla they're the only ones not doing dealer gouging). But OP can't afford a Tesla any more than he can afford two purebreed dogs or a new truck.;jkaahhj;11br2l;cg6ee
To be clear I’m saying the *total price* should be at most 30-40% of your income. Not that the *payments* should consume 30-40% of your income. The payment on a $40k car financed over 5 years is like $700. That’s easily doable on a $100k salary without sacrificing retirement savings or lifestyle.;jkaznh4;14nn48;cg6ee
It’s somewhat reasonable honestly. I think you are confusing the fact that the car is likely financed over 3-5 years so the payments per year are divided by that term. It’s not a third of his income going to the car every year. So a person making 100K with a car value of 30-40k but the payments are less than 10k per year.;jka8nv9;72iym;cg6ee
I’m talking about total cost not monthly expenses. ie if you make $100k don’t buy a car over $40k.;jkbfiga;14nn48;s14de9u
Get an AWD with good winter tires like an Impreza or a Crosstrek for $10-15k and you'll be fine. 95% of people that own trucks don't need them.;jk962so;31uyndg7;mjaii3op
Trucks are one of the worst snow/ice vehicles. The are high center of gravity terrible weight distribution and heavy. Get a used FWD/AWD with all weather tires and you will be multiple times safer. The only reason to get a truck in a snowy environment might be to generate income by plowing even that’s largely just break eve due to the strain you put on the vehicle. Trucks are basically toys unless you need them for your job.;jk9low1;1xripidz;mjaii3op
You can drive just about any car in any weather in the US with proper tires. The most popular car in Finland is a Toyota Corolla followed by the Yaris.You co-signed to poverty when you bought that truck.;jk9xoi6;7fmqp;mjaii3op
Dude my Subaru mades it through the Rockies on the regular. It was $10000… get a different car.;jk9s9ht;xezy4;mjaii3op
An old subaru would have probably been fine for snow and a bit easier on the gas.;jkaared;11br2l;mjaii3op
Get Corolla cross with AWD;jkaxdek;81m4imam;mjaii3op
Sell ur truck get an awd vehicle that costs $12000 or less. That would cut your car payment by nearly 2/3. Or just get an awd truck that isn't brand spankin new;jka6ove;qvne1;mjaii3op
Agreed I would need more info on op’s average rent where he lives. For me I get a 1x1 for 1500 which is crazy but on the cheaper side for right now most places are around 2k for that. Inflation is real;jka192y;ckiye;tji76lez
Old school beater SUV gang! I played in the NFL for a few years now I’m a software engineer I drive a 2007 Nissan Xterra. It is super modded but still very very cheap relative to what many people are driving. It is the newest car I’ve ever owned. Used to get tons of crap from my teammates because I didn’t buy a Lambo now they want to know why they’re broke and I’m not when they got better contracts.;jkbyr5w;12vbj8;p3j2k
I make 8k a month net and I don’t really understand car payments. Seems like it would be better to just save up and buy a car outright. But maybe that’s my privilege talking. If you need a loan for something that depreciates (this notably excludes education or a mortgage in a rising area) you just can’t afford it.;jkbvuvo;4gc51;p3j2k
An avocado near me is about 3 bucks good bread is generally sold fresh by the loaf for another 5 (now I have too much bread!) the three minutes of my time is worth about 6 bucks. That’s already the same price as a restaurant avocado toast (runs about 14 bucks near me on average I’d guess). I also can’t make good avocado toast in 3 minutes.You want fresh diced onions fresh lemon juice toasted bread an extracted and whipped avocado…Whether it’s worth it depends on how much money you make and whether you enjoy cooking at all. For many people it makes no economic sense to cook. I still like to cook occasionally because it’s relaxing but honestly I’d be better off economically plowing that time into work and eating out instead.;jkbwwiv;4gc51;12vf9q
My cars doing fine at 169k 💪 I got that mythical r/personal finance whip;jkbpvc2;1p71mh9g;pvbb5

$524 a month for a 1 bedroom no security deposit 1st month free and my friends got a free month as well for referring me. Denver metro. Made about 30K. It was an early 70's tissue box ashtray of a place. But it was mine! Looking at their website It now would run 1300 a month for ones with very minor cosmetic updates 1500 for ones with moderate updates or 1700 for gutted and fully renovated versions. If I still had that job it would probably pay about 42K to start.;jkd1753;6m5a8fh0;e4nwu
Where do you live? 2003?;jkaa079;3g6jl;mjaii3op
You are lucky. Cars are unfortunately expensive and $500 a month is maybe a lot but cars have gotten expensive. How long till you have the loan paid off? If you are close to paying for off the loan keep the car.I'd rather look at options to increase your income.;jkadfc9;12vf9q;mjaii3op
Damn I don't think I could survive the summer. I live in a college town in the Pacific Northwest and I couldn't live in a place much hotter than where I am now lol.;jk9lzwa;zvlb0;11o44t

I make 70k and can’t afford even a $300 car payment. (Technically yes I could make it happen but adding maintenance gas insurance etc on top of it it’s just not wise). HCOL area also so $70k doesn’t go far.;jkb90f0;ioygd;4eqd40bh
Except OP isnt making 70k a year? He makes 20 per hour which at a minimum would be closer to 40k.;jkabj56;f5rwkf54;4eqd40bh
Man $700/month is a lot.  Personally that's something I couldn't stomach.  I make about $100k and I bought a $22k car outright.  I just can't stand a $700/month payment.;jkcpn4f;cg6ee;14nn48
You don't even need AWD if you have good winter tires. That's coming from someone in Sweden. You could drive essentially anything but a soft-top cab.;jk972lh;sdbfx;31uyndg7
That’s assuming you don’t need ground clearance to get over 12” of unplowed snow. Most people drive on plowed roads so a sedan with winter tires will work. But we don’t know what conditions OP had to drive in.;jk9a4wx;1457yg;31uyndg7
I loved my Subie in high-desert winters. I live in a metro where an inch of snow brings everything to its knees now and I work from home so nowadays I drive a FWD with siped tires for rain and it’s been fine. If I had to go back to snow on the ground 5 months out of the year though I’d get me another Subaru.;jk9uu79;ebeiskq;xezy4
Air bnb and corporations buying up housing is real. 8-11 percent inflation doesn’t account for 50-200 percent increases in pricing on things.Companies are using “INFLATION!!!!!” To pass off insane price increases and then end the year with record profits.;jkad8c0;k9ulk;ckiye
Lolol I can kinda relate: I was a stripper in a major US city for several years and bought what my coworkers said was a “mom car” (my roommates were slightly nicer and jokingly said it was a _cool_ mom car) when they all got beemers Porsches convertibles etc. but I researched the hell outta that purchase (which was also the newest/nicest vehicle I’d ever bought) and it’s still running like a dream ten years later with really low maintenance costs. Ironically I’m still not a mom but most of my old coworkers are now moms with run-down minivans.I’ve always wished there were people in our respective industries (because I danced for a lot of super sweet pro athletes who were definitely not being smart w/their money) who like went around and did basic money management classes for these 18-25yo kids who get huge windfalls of cash and have little to no guidance on how to spend/invest it wisely.;jkc78n8;6h2tzsbj;12vbj8
What’s a your name? What team did you play for?;jkc7715;89uxyxz8;12vbj8
">I make 8k a month net and I don’t really understand car payments.Financing a vehicle is typically done because people don't have enough cash saved or can't save up enough cash quickly enough. Monthly payments allow them to get the vehicle ""now"" instead of later -- if they don't pay off the loan quickly they typically spend far more money than they would just saving up the initial purchase price but that is the price of convenience.";jkbx9y6;bdyje;4gc51
And you prove that not everyone who makes solid money is intelligent. Cars in a lot of places around the world are a requirement especially in the US and Canada. North American cities are really walkable outside of deep Central America;jkbxctg;iu92i;4gc51
Unless you're actually going to use that time saved to make money (and be sure to make enough to also account for the marginal tax rates) you're not saving any money by paying someone to do something that you can do for free -- especially when it's entirely optional in the first place. You are in fact just spending more money but lying to yourself about it.;jkc4xmb;3d49aad;4gc51
It would be cost per slice of bread not loaf unless you just waste the other bread. And most of the time you’re not getting a whole avocado on the restaurant toast so it would be the price I’d say half of one and a squeeze of lemon juice. Onions and lemon juice are cheap. But I think you may be pulling everyone’s leg anyway!;jkd0o4u;bgc1rqt8;4gc51
I feel like at like 150k serious repairs start coming or they become very unreliable for a lot of people. But I'm happy for you 😂;jkcxmj8;pvbb5;1p71mh9g

Yeah house values and rents have gone insane. Definitely not sustainable;jkbfe6s;5wpkv;9ssy2
Lol my rent was like $450 before my wife and I bought our house last year. People who live in the city can't seem to believe that there are still large tracts of less desirable land that isn't $2500 a month to rent. My mortgage is only like $800 a month. The downside is there is fuck all to do except play video games watch movies and do drugs unless you like bowling.;jkabyn2;jxtsp;3g6jl

Meh everywhere you go has a/c anyway. Its just walking to your car and back that sucks if you dont want to be in the heat. And hopefully thats only a few months out of the year;jkbw1kq;phhkd;zvlb0
Well yeah the price increase in that period of time is absurd but the same thing has happened with houses everywhere not just rent.  Also Macon is like the third or fourth most populous city in Georgia so its not super surprising that it would be more expensive than where I'm at.;jkcu0fy;11o44t;epjxwf1n
Right so he shouldn’t have the truck.;jk94d0o;n9y6r;aiaq2
No what the other guy was suggesting was a 10-15k car is what OP SHOULD HAVE at his level of income. And I tend to agree.  OP bought way more care than he should have.;jk94hwi;dytqc;aiaq2
I never said that OP makes 70k nor can afford a 21k car. But the guy who I responded to said that 30-40% of salary is “insanely high” to spend on a car which I disagree. 70k which is a typical middle class single income would get you a 21k car at 30% of salary. There are literally like 3 models in the US you can get with that money.;jkb9q9r;4eqd40bh;f5rwkf54
Ya agreed. I make it fine in the Northeast US with a FWD Ford Focus. People over-buying on cars is such a plague.;jk97vul;31uyndg7;sdbfx
It depends on the state. Some states require AWD/4WD even with snow tires unless you want to put on chains all the time;jk9wps6;xbo2d;sdbfx
There are laws in some parts of the US that require them or sometimes chains in the snow. Rural areas aren't known exactly for their great roads in the US;jkbtki5;mjf0d;sdbfx
Which is why I said Crosstrek. It has plenty of clearance unless you're trying to bushwhack in rural Alaska in February but even then it should be able to get you there the vast majority of the time. Great vehicle.;jk9dzm1;31uyndg7;1457yg
Hell yeah I love my outback. As someone who regularly crosses the Rockies and cascade mountains that thing has held up to so much abuse and does it with ease;jk9v1k4;xezy4;ebeiskq
Yeah it’s insane when I moved into my apartment last year it was 1200 they tried to increase my rent to 1600 this year (I talked them down to 1350) now they’re trying to increase it to 2100 in July. Let’s just say moving in with the in laws are going to pay off for 1000 flat;jkadexr;ckiye;k9ulk
True.  Also up until recently you could get a car loan for 1-3%.  You could invest the money and get a higher return or take the money out and pay it off when you wanted.;jkd1ddc;jcq8jt06;bdyje
His comment is opposed to *financing* a car not owning a car.;jkci2ov;87orf1fy;iu92i
Never lived in a city without bus service. Many also have train service. Spending a third of your income financing a car is fucking stupid. It’s a great way to stay poor.If you need to finance a car (I think there are some legitimate cases of that especially in rural areas) it should be minimal otherwise you’re just selling your future for today.It seems to me that there are tons of people with monthly car payments so they can have a nicer car than they can afford not out of necessity. That I totally don’t get.;jkbxy0z;4gc51;iu92i
You’re making a mistake of considering my time worthless. It’s absolutely not. Opportunity cost is not restricted to the realm of money.;jkcb33m;4gc51;3d49aad

>There are literally like 3 models in the US you can get with that money.There are many more models of used cars available at that price or less.;jkc7str;bpqvs;4eqd40bh
I honestly can't say I agree. I've gone through rough blizzards in -20 with decimeters of snow with both rwd and fwd. You just need good tires and be careful with how you drive;jk9y7vm;sdbfx;xbo2d
Which states exactly have this requirement of both snow tires and AWD/4WD ?;jka1osw;16vn8t;xbo2d
No one is saying his car payment isn’t high but look at most American cities public transport and walkability your fucked unless you live in areas that aren’t safe. It’s how American cities public transport is set up most major American cities it’s impossible to get across town on public transport without it taking multiple hours. American public transport is designed to move people from older suburbs to downtown district and most people these days have to commute from a suburb to a suburb for work.;jkbyzkc;iu92i;4gc51
I live in the second largest city of my state. Our public transportation is atrociously limited and the walkability is also very sad. You NEED a car here unless you plan on using Lyft or Uber every day.;jkc1pq6;efcoa6i;4gc51
Up until recently you could get car loans for 2% or less with good credit. Most ppl are making more investing. High yield savings accounts now come in at 4%. From an investment standpoint you’re walking away from a free 2% if you buy the car outright. Now that would be stupid;jkcqrfz;16rghf;4gc51

Eh if you can afford to buy it outright and fuelling it doesn’t strain the budget I think it’s fine.;jkblrbj;n9y6r;95xmh
Whether or not you agree is irrelevant. Certain states such as California require it by law;jk9ymwh;xbo2d;sdbfx
"CA does for sure. I think there was something similar with Nevada. CA technically has R0-R3 with R1 being ""snow tires but not AWD/4WD required"" but I can count on one hand the number of times I've seen it conditions as R1. It's basically always R0 (no restrictions) R2 (AWD with snow tires or chains required) or R3 (closed)";jka2g93;xbo2d;16vn8t
Sounds pretty crappy not gonna lie. Ever thought about moving? A lot of the cities with good public transportation pay a lot more and then you don’t need a car!Your point is well taken though. I’ve only ever lived in coastal cities with at least decent transit. I was viewing this as going into debt to cut a 60 minute public transit commute to a 30 minute drive or something like that but in rural or very suburban areas I can see where a car becomes practically a necessity.;jkca5xn;4gc51;efcoa6i

Last year I got an MRI at the hospital. When I went in to get the MRI the hospital mentioned nothing about it not being approved and gave me the MRI. Insurance went on to deny the claim saying the location wasn't approved (apparently they wanted me to get it done at an imaging center). Now the hospital wants me to pay $7000.I've called the hospital they said to appeal the claim. I appealed the claim and never heard back about it until now. In this time the bill unfortunately went to collections which I am told complicates things ever further. They told me to appeal again and I am just so stressed out from the runaround. What do I do?;13is2ps;6e2os;

Appeal it under the No Surprises Act which bans “Out-of-network charges and balance bills for supplemental care like radiology or anesthesiology by out-of-network providers that work at an in-network facility”Basically if the hospital or doctor who referred you to the hospital is within network they can’t refuse to pay for the MRI at the hospital;jkbrojb;ix1ll;6e2os
This just happened with my husbands medically necessary colonoscopy. The hospital said it was fully covered by his insurance but then sent us a $5k bill. Turns out insurance won’t cover a medically necessary colonoscopy unless it’s done in a stand alone clinic. We appealed even filed a claim with Dora insurance division. They sent a letter to his insurance. The hospital sent the bill to collections. Insurance came back with a packet basically explaining why they won’t cover it. Hospital gave him a small discount but that’s about it. Insurance can really suck sometimes.;jkbmuv1;n8py6;6e2os
Call up the hospital and ask how much the same MRI is without insurance.  Get the persons name.  Pay the hospital that amount of money if they will rescind the collection account.  If they do not do so get an attorney to write a letter to sue them.   The standard charge in my high cost area for no insurance is $400 to $800 for a standard MRI.  A 10 time markup to insurance companies is standard procedure for a hospital.  It is a hospital scam to send accounts to collection when under insurance appeal.  Insurance claims each time takes 4 months.  You can also file a complaint with your state department of insurance for the above abuses.;jkc3679;ctnq8;6e2os
"Ten years ago I got a septoplasty and my insurance denied the claim after approving it. They said my doctor didn't put me through a range of medicine first to solve the problem. I called the doc and he said ""What medicine can straighten your sinuses?"" Doc ended up paying half and I was out of pocket 5k. Worth every penny to breathe clear but it still pisses me off. Fuck health insurance companies. They are in business to collect from you and then bend you over.";jkbwl68;1vzrmi93;6e2os
$7000 is a ludicrous price for an MRI. Get their best price from any PPO plan that covers MRIs in that hospital or their cash up front price and don't pay them a penny more. It should be about 10% of the chargemaster price their trying to bill you.Any hospital doing an MRI without properly verifying insurance coverage ought to forced to eat the full price themselves.;jkc5szb;kb17c;6e2os
Appeal again like they said.  Pretty much all you can do.The lesson here is to pay very close attention to your referral assuming your insurance uses referrals.  They say exactly what’s authorized from who and where.  A hospital MRI is often going to be more expensive which is why they didn’t authorize that.  What your insurance covers is ultimately between you and your insurer not your provider.  When expensive tests like MRIs are involved check double check then check again before getting it done.That’s for next time though.  All you can do now is keep appealing.  If that doesn’t work you can ask the hospital about financial assistance or lowering the bill.  They’ll work with you if you can show you don’t have the money but if you have a pretty good income you’re probably stuck.  While medical debt under $500 is no longer reported to the credit bureaus this isn’t that.;jkbf8ps;zeln01h;6e2os
This thread makes me sad to read. Healthcare shouldn't cause *more* stress than it already induces;jkcizlb;2oa7uiq5;6e2os
I don’t have advice for you but I’m so sorry. This is my American nightmare that I fret over any time I need medical care. I have good insurance but one simple mistake of location or provider is financially disastrous.;jkbei9w;3oh5aq5l;6e2os
Try applying for financial assistance. Sometimes there is a phone number or contact on the back side of the bill. Sometimes hospital has a dedicated personnel and office where they offer these services. Its usually income bracket based and depends on the family size.;jkca9e8;13avyz;6e2os
Appeal! This happened to me a few months back and they approved it after the second try.;jkbq5oa;ml2nb124;6e2os
You fight.   Don't pay it.Keep calling and emailing the insurance.  That's what I did.   The hospital company sent me to collections.  I still didn't pay it.  After some months the insurance company and the hospital hashed it out.   Keep calling emailing and fighting.From [https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/know-your-rights-and-protections-when-it-comes-to-medical-bills-and-collections/](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/know-your-rights-and-protections-when-it-comes-to-medical-bills-and-collections/)>Shortly following the issuance of the report Equifax Experian and TransUnion issued a joint statement  to announce they were changing how medical bills would be reported on credit reports. Beginning July 1 2022 paid medical bills will no longer be included on credit reports issued by those three companies. Unpaid bills will be reported only if they have remained unpaid for at least 12 months. Additionally the companies announced that starting in July 2023 they will not include information furnished to them for medical bills in collection for amounts of $500 or less.;jkcwkn3;11sgjr;6e2os
If the hospital IS in your network they are only supposed to set up things like that within the network.   They have to eat the bill.This happened to me once with some lab work years ago.   Insurance had a contract with the medical group but not with the lab they sent me to.   Insurance dealt with the medical group and I didn't have to pay the lab bill.Get all your insurance EOB stuff together and the hospital bill and call your insurance.You should have dealt with this when it first happened but hopefully you can get it sorted.;jkbfog8;3j0glzm8;6e2os
I’m going through almost this exact situation right now.;jkbuw8r;edztk;6e2os
In hindsight you should always check with your insurance company prior to any procedures if of course you are able to;jkcp8mc;svg3s3ed;6e2os
Similar thing happened to me recently. I had a follow up MRI late in the year that should’ve been mostly covered by a high deductible HSA plan. Several months later I got a bill for about $900 for my share of what my insurance company would not pay. It turned out that while the hospital was “in-network” the MRI center within the hospital was only “participating” and therefore was charged to my “out of pocket” deductible.  I was pretty pissed because I had called both the hospital and my insurance company prior to the MRI to make sure that it was going to be covered even going as far as paying my share of the cost (~$80) in advance and getting a slight discount for it which I thought was a win for me! When I finally got a bill for about $900 I called both the MRI center and my insurance to try to figure out what was going on.  At first I was told by a rather helpful agent for the insurance company to ask for an appeal but supposedly it never went through.  A few months later I got a notice that the bill was going to be sent to collections so I ended up calling the hospital and was told by the rep there that the only way to figure this out was to get a three-way call with hospital representatives and get everyone to agree that the charges were bullshit.  I ended up spending about 90 minutes on the phone the other day when I finally got through to someone on the hospital side who after looking at it saw that I had called in to their facility to ask for pricing prior to the treatment but couldn’t verify any of the information in the call (I.e. no real notes were taken on their end).  The conclusion was that since they could not verify anything they decided to eat the cost of the MRI and admitted to such while the insurance company was on the phone.  The representative from the hospital later followed up with written documentation to prove that they had to cover the cost and I had a zero balance 😁Lesson learned from this was 1) Take better notes on my end prior to any procedure and if possible record all names of the people I talk to and 2) pushback hard on anything that doesn’t look right!  Even if a medical bill goes to collections and does go on your credit once it is paid off or resolved it is immediately removed or can be by asking.  Best of luck to you !;jkcxfz2;40azki6s;6e2os
Appeal the decision and file a complaint with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service. No Surprises Act should cover this.https://www.cms.gov/nosurprises/consumers/complaints-about-medical-billing;jkbtcyf;eleg1;6e2os
Hey I used to work in mental health insurance. I also have had to MRIs for my own health. I have a hospital who has a department who specializes in my disorder and I wanted to have my MRI there. Insurance called me after the hospital called for prior authorization saying I should go to a stand-alone clinic because it is cheaper. I already reached my Out of Pocket Max so I didn’t really care plus I wanted the specialist and team to work on it. 1.) did you confirm with your insurance that that MRI met “medical necessity” and clinic was INN. If so tell your insurance that on a prior call you were told it was INN and met medical Necessity.  2.) ask to speak with a supervisor and appeal it. I once had a claim that was denied because they saw it as “elective” and not truly medically necessary even though I confirmed before hand and it was. My provider and myself wrote a letter to the insurance explaining why it was. My provider also called. Boom it was approved3.) Ask for what is needed for an A Single Case Agreement (SCA) is a one-time contract between an insurance company and an out-of-network provider so the patient can see that provider using their in-network benefits.4.) If you did not confirm with your insurance and you find out you did not meet medial necessity you might be on the hook. If the above options don’t work I’d call the hospital and negotiate pricing if possible..though I am not sure if you can do this with it being in collections. Most hospitals are required to give relief if people are facing financial hardship. Other notes for the future. Take notes when you cal your insurance or hospital. Date agent you spoke with and summary of call. Come with those receipts when they try and pull bullshit and deny your claim.  I have a google doc spreadsheet. People know I’m not messing around when I start naming agents and times of my last call. (Do it respectfully the agent on the phone usually cares and wasn’t the one who denied the claim/created the issue) Truly I am sorry you have to put up with this bullshit. You should not have to.;jkcna3l;8srki9z4;6e2os
"Here how it works. Always refer to what is called ""Summary of Benefits"" or verify on the insurance website what is the cost for a procedure. I have a scheduled MRI for this week. On my insurance website there are three prices all depend on where I would have the procedure done. It will cost $5 if I the procedure is done at a doctor's office (who in the world has an MRI at their office I don't know). Then I will pay a co-insurance which is a percentage amount if I have it at an Imaging Center and the third option way more expensive if I have the procedure in a hospital. Yes the procedure is the same but inside a hospital would cost much more. Because it is a percentage amount the price depends on the hospital/imaging center rates. In my case I have to pay $100 to have it at the imaging center.";jkbr5f7;899dwv9u;6e2os
A standard rate for an MRI is about $2k even without insurance. Was this MRI perhaps incident to a car accident and you were referred to a particular hospital by plaintiff attorney? I don't want to sound mean but your story doesn't make sense... there is some context missing here. $7k does sorta sound like what the less than legit legal / medical locations charge. You should ask your personal injury attorney to pick it up on LOP.;jkcdtqk;10wmyq;6e2os
apply for financial assistance at the hospital.;jkbs6j4;qsne2k1j;6e2os
Insurance will adjudicate a claim based on billing codes they receive from providers. And I've seen providers using the wrong billing codes in my line of work before which is sadly common at times and you really got to hound them or educate them to use the right one. People here mentioned the no surprised act but that's for true emergency versus non-emergencies. MRIs at a hospital versus a non-hospital imaging center cost different including the billing code used. This might be the reason why it's not covered - Obviously guessing based on limited info here.I'm not sure who you have your insurance through but I recommend connecting with the benefits team or someone equivalent. They can help you look into this while you go through the appeals process further. Additionally I would go through your provider insurance network to see if the hospital is listed anywhere as in-network on the off chance so you can use that in favor of your appeal.If you are on the hook for it in the end. You can negotiate the price down further by dealing with the hospital/collections.Good luck!;jkbwlb5;jozct;6e2os
Was this from an emergency visit?;jkcqbhv;d6idg;6e2os
Depending on your state if your insurance company does not respond to your formal internal appeal in the right turnaround time (generally 30-60 days) it is considered approved OR you have the right to appeal directly to the department of insurance (in your state) also called an external appeal. If you don't already have it call your insurance company and ask for your Utilization Management denial letter and read the rights it lays out for you.;jkcw9pv;rs790;6e2os
In addition to appealing through the No Surprises Act as mentioned elsewhere you can look at the hospitals Financial Assistance page and see if you can apply for financial assistance. Generally if your income is less than 300% of the Federal Poverty Line (so about $45k/yr) you don't owe anything to the hospital and above that income they may factor in monthly expenses to get a sense of how much you can realistically pay.;jkcwem5;10w89h;6e2os
Keep fighting it. They're counting on you to give up and pay it.;jkbmjgt;ah6z9uw7;6e2os
Yeah- you need to keep appealing. Did you get a prior authorization before getting the MRI and  check if the hospital was in network?;jkbmvts;47kuj;6e2os

It really depends on the specific plan.  Most people with employer based major medical insurance are actually in a self insured plan which is not even insurance in the legal sense.Self insured plans are regulated by the DOL as opposed to state insurance departments. The plan may require imaging services to be obtained at a free standing imaging center as opposed to a hospital  - a self insured plan can do that.The point is that the OP needs to check his plan.;jkc9a3d;7tsakl2u;6e2os
In the USA never never never never have any medical thing done until you contact your insurance.  Even then get it in writing. Sorry for your situation  but one of the terrible things about USA health care is that you are just screwed and you'll have to pay the cost.   If your insurance doesn't cover that particular MRI place  then it doesn't cover it.  Keep appealing the decision  you can get an 'arbiter/3rd party' to look at the situation.  Good luck.    You can also try to negotiate with the hospital on paying it talk to their finance department about that. Unfortunately one of the real shitty things about hospital billing in the USA is that the hospital will send it to collections no matter what even if you are disputing the bill and even if you are right.;jkbhbrb;g7mpqsdg;6e2os
Not a great recommendation but you can also attempt to negotiate a lower price with collections and hope for the best but it’s far from ideal.;jkbwj27;yzzkd;6e2os

Out of curiosity why did you go to a hospital for a non emergency MRI? That’s very unusual unless you live in a very rural area where there aren’t non emergency health facilities so I’m wondering how that happened.;jkcrn1m;jktdgt9q;6e2os

>> when I went in to get the MRI the hospital mentioned nothing about it not being approved and gave me the MRI.

Offer the hospital some cash. Once (for a relative) on a 50k bill they accepted 25k in cash. I guess the more appealing route is to appeal but the hospital should be happy with SOME money.Edit: I wasn't very succinct. Ask the billing department for a break. See if they will negotiate paying less - they will if you can guarantee paying them something. The amount and schedule work out with the hospital. There are also services that negotiate your bill for you. But they want a percentage of the amount they saved you.;jkbg08v;10g7mh;6e2os

It sounds like you did not do very good job of managing your personal business. One needs to know what their insurance covers and does not cover especially before getting non-standard testing done. Non-standard as in not a routine item.

Appeal again with insurance company and keep the hospital informed as well. Have to be on it as soon as you get a bill from hospital you call them and explain things many times they have a hardship process. Many hospitals have charities and charity funds to pay for folks who legitimately cannot afford the bill where a monthly payment would take years and years to close the account.When my daughter was born the bill was over $116K and insurance was refusing to cover anything. Long story short the hospital sued the insurance company to get payment. Insurance settled with the hospital. Now we still had other bills to pay so we negotiated with those companies (lots of stuff was outsourced to contractors like anesthesiologist etc) so we got all kinds of surprise bills. We negotiated the bills down with the companies then started payment plans with them. Basically told them “I cannot afford this bill in full I can afford $50 per month for this bill.” They threatened collections and I said “do you want something or nothing I cannot afford this” and rattled off all of the other bills. They usually get silent and then say “we will accept your terms.” We saved our receipts and the bills and then we itemized them during tax time got a lot of money back and then we immediately paid off what we could to close different accounts. It was an incredibly stressful time in my life. Took about 4 years to close all of those accounts. Pay check to paycheck for four years and first kid… tough times.I hope you are able to get this sorted out. All I can say is try to find things to do that bring joy that are free and or cost a little so you can maintain sanity and not spiral into severe depression.;jkcr0kc;gh9rt1jt;6e2os
I would keep trying appeal and if it doesn’t work  talk to the hospital make sure your getting charge the amount that they charge a person and not insurance company;jkcrptq;9cxtp2r6;6e2os
This happened to me with cigna.  Call your insurance provider and tell them to 3 way call the hospital billing department.  They have to do this and every billing person I've talked to is more than happy to help you stick the insurance company with the bill.Edit - if your in network provider refers you for an mri then it should be covered.  This is pretty common with anesthesiologists.;jkcsqkr;blvke;6e2os
Unfortunately  I learned the hard way to look up my policy online every time for all tests and procedures whether they're in or out of network. The providers and their offices will SAY they're in network when they are not. I call my insurance and read online with them to clarify. I've been burned once too many times by this out of network crap.;jkcuq4e;3wwyd;6e2os
"Pretty much all insurance companies have a representative within your place of work whose job it is to pursue this very type of thing. Reach out to him or her they are usually called a ""patient care advocate"" or sometimes plan administrator or similar.";jkcvn0q;l06osxhd;6e2os
7 grand is an absolutely bonkers rate just for an MRI.  The total charges for X-ray films and MRI study on my knee about 4 years ago amounted to half of that total even before insurance.;jkcz71k;w25g3;6e2os

"I like how a recent ultrasound for me ended.Imaging center billed it as a ""study"" to insurance insurance rejected it because while ultrasounds are covered studies require pre-auth (insurance agent explained some centers regularly try and overbill ultrasounds as studies).

Holy shit I wish I knew about this when I had a combo colonoscopy/endoscopy where I had to be out under. My GI doc who was in network did the procedure but the facility and apparently anesthesiologist weren’t in network and I ended up paying like 3-4k when I thought it was only supposed to cost a few hundredEdit: looked it up and my procedure was several years ago so the act didn’t exist yet. Still a very good thing to know about;jkch5lu;137zja;ix1ll
There is a large company that has been purposefully doing these types of shinagigans and it was legal until the No Surprises Act was passed. I would research this to see what you can do. Don't give up! Call Clark Howard as he is a consumer advocate and see what his team says to do. You need to fight for your money and this is clearly wrong. So sorry about it - ugh!;jkbwzzw;ics5hp09;ix1ll
No that is not what the law says. The intention is that when you are at an in-network facility for let’s say surgery you cannot have the anesthesiologist bill you as out of network. Since OP went there specifically for an MRI it was incumbent on OP to find out if it was in network. PSA: NEVER go to a hospital for diagnostic tests you can get elsewhere because hospitals always charge an order of magnitude more for them to help defray the losses for providing un reimbursed care.;jkcovp0;famp6;ix1ll
Yeah but my insurance carrier still requires prior authorization for certain medical treatments. So if the MRI wasn’t due to some emergent need OP may still be out of luck. The hospital and radiology part could be in network. But due to lack of approval they don’t want to cover it. Healthcare makes me want to smash my head against a wall.;jkcsjtb;mit47;ix1ll
Second;jkbsgtw;5jw6yxur;ix1ll
Except providers are starting to get you to sign a waiver which then makes you responsible again.  It’s even worse as my provider just makes you sign an electronic signature pad at the counter and doesn’t bother to show you what you are signing for me to even pretend to read it.;jkcqvmm;15jroq;ix1ll
Lot of fancy words that dont go together. Also no surprise applies to ER pathology anesthesia etc. There are choices on where you get your MRI and if the plan has guidelines and rules on where you must go. This will be very hard to fight and especially if you try to argue the above.;jkbvcna;cn2dd;ix1ll
This isn’t balance billing though and doesn’t seem to be supplemental care. This is a a case of the insurer denying coverage because it wasn’t at the authorized location.;jkcs2sw;z6415;ix1ll
No surprise act doesn’t apply here only if it’s an in network facility with an out of network provider or emergency services. If the radiologist reading the results were OON then OP would have a case but not if the MRI-which is hospital billing- is denied.;jkcvops;i3jt3;ix1ll

I’m curious if this is similar to what happened to me.  I gave birth at an in network hospital.  The total bill wasn’t actually that bad (weirdly they billed a “standard” birth up front based on my insurance and I had to prepay… even was able to get a refund for not getting the epidural…. $1k! but I had to ask for the itemization to see it on there). Anyway the pediatrician in the hospital who did the morning round was not in network and his bill was crazy for his 5 min checkup.;jkctvek;z6ryk;ix1ll
I'm getting hit with a $700 bill from a lab which at the time said that my insurance would cover the cost for some x-rays I got done about a year or so ago. Would my situation also fall under such act?;jkcu5qz;edtbw;ix1ll

These insurance companies have a pretty good scheme they do. They call it “Bad faith insurance” in most cases but it’s extremely common for insurance companies to deny claims and make it extremely difficult in hopes a few people won’t fight back.;jkbuk4a;elkbj;n8py6
all the time its a big scam.if it wasn't accepted why would they take it in the first place?;jkbs4kq;qsne2k1j;n8py6
Will insurance give you a letter showing a particular thing will be covered?;jkc1fbm;795uay8x;n8py6
> The hospital said it was fully covered by his insurance but then sent us a $5k bill.Just 2 years ago a regular colonoscopy was just ~$2000;jkd0vcu;uf0p9h27;n8py6
What if you didn’t pay it?I don’t understand everyone’s desire to pay their medical debt. It’s not like they can come after you. (The hospital won’t but a debt collector will. You will want to settle BEFORE the debt is sold to a debt collector)One time I broke a leg without insurance hospital billed me 24k for surgery. I didn’t pay it. 1 year later they asked if I would pay 4k. After discussions with their finance department we settled at $1900. My credit score went from like 620 to 740 the second I paid it off. I’ve told numerous family members that if you can handle having a lower credit score until paying off the debt then do it. 3 other family members have lowered their medical bill by 90% just waiting to pay it off…;jkc02cr;8kceswi8;n8py6
Yep. My insurance company called me shortly before my second central brain craniotomy. Recurrent glioma collection 30% odds of dying on the table and all that jazz. My neurosurgeon and neuroncologist were expecting the surgery to merely buy me some time and function before probable medical aid in dying. The representative on the phone sounded like a kid speaking as someone who was barely 30 myself. She was plainly reading from a script. Had I tried treating my cancer with diet and exercise? As this call made no sense I started with verifying that she had the right person to call. She confirmed that she did and that she had very little background beyond “brain cancer.” When she learned more she was completely mortified. I blame company policy not her. Part of what now makes my tale ironic is that I may indeed be a case where dietary adjustments did some good. My pathology team won’t be able to learn further until I die.;jkccbzq;59w709zi;1vzrmi93
>Fuck health insurance companies. They are in business to collect from you and then bend you over.ALL insurance companies are in business to collect your money and do everything they can from paying it back when you need it. I absolutely hate insurance companies with all of my heart and if Hell exists they have a spot waiting for them down there.;jkd3vhs;40zhaozlk;1vzrmi93
I wonder how common that price is with hospitals.    I had to have an MRI of my brain several years ago and the best quote or local hospital would give me was $5500 to $7000.  A local practice that does orthopedics and imaging quoted me around 4000 and I thought that was great until I coworker mentioned a place about 45 minutes away that his wife had one for a much cheaper MRI on her elbow. It ended up only costing me around $1700;jkct6dd;e4fyk;kb17c
You’re blaming the hospital but they dont determine insurance coverage. Very very often insurance says something is covered and the. Isn’t. The providers shouldn’t eat that cost. That’s the insurance company to blame most of the time.;jkchc50;5avbn6vd;kb17c
My wife had an MRI about 8 years ago that the hospital said was covered. Turns out it wasn't. I just didn't pay the damn bill! They might have sent me a bill every month for 7 years but it finally went away.;jkd0pkc;x8fsl;kb17c
No surprises law covers this now;jkd77wn;c5tw6;zeln01h
Most people somehow know not to go to a hospital for non emergency stuff and go to a local imaging center;jkcqyo0;qj4xf;2oa7uiq5
The prospect of daily phone calls for months is almost as bad as just coughing up the money;jkd5suk;6e2os;11sgjr
Great link thanks!;jkcxpq7;39kg3670;eleg1
In practice you’ll want to set some money aside every month as if you were paying the bill. Each time they call check the account and let them know that you can pay it off with a lump sum of “$x”. Ignore all other methods to pay. Repeat until they accept the terms or give up. If it goes to court show them the statements and tell them that you offered to pay “$x” but the collector refused to accept. Keep organized notes.;jkc5hud;mmvnw;yzzkd
This may have happened before that relatively recent law.;jkclavv;zzo7u;pulz4

>shinagigans   Sound this out for me.;jkd1le2;h9qg8;ics5hp09
Not always true. My local hospital does MRI’s for a cash price that’s pretty much the same as driving a few hours (what we’d have to do) to an imaging center. A little over $300. And it’s not like it’s skimping on quality. The surgeon I took it to said it’s one of the best MRI’s he’d seen. If the MRI is something your doctor needs then my advice would be to first ask the MRI facility if they accept your insurance and second I’d ask what their cash self pay price is. They may accept your insurance but it may take a few weeks to get approved by your insurance. In both my cases two MRI’s in the past year and a half I needed to know soon what my issue was so the $300 was worth it.;jkcyw4i;28639uoz;famp6
I doubt that type of oversight would past the medical providers legal team. Regardless you are entitled to informed consent. It makes no difference because you will not get the procedure without agreeing to whatever the medical provider is asking of you.> Except providers are starting to get you to sign a waiver which then makes you responsible again. It’s even worse as my provider just makes you sign an electronic signature pad at the counter and doesn’t bother to show you what you are signing for me to even pretend to read it.;jkcti1f;protc;15jroq
I disagree: If the hospital was in-network it seems pretty clear to me. Insurances can’t decide that a hospital is in-network but certain services at the hospital aren’t covered. A lot of times you would go the ER they’ll triage you and send you home to come back tomorrow for an MRI or some additional tests because they still need to be done but you don’t warrant a bed.;jkbx5zo;ix1ll;cn2dd
Typically most ambulance services are out of network - but a true emergency is paid at the in network level of benefits regardless of provider. A service like a non emergency medical transport may or may not be covered depending on your plan.  Source: I put many years in the trenches of insurance customer support.;jkcnj00;zu0l2;eisys8fb
No. Found it out the hard way. I had to have a separate company fight the charge for me. It apparently doesn’t apply to ambulances but does apply for airlifts. Ambulances are scams;jkcn5ua;auc1rymb;eisys8fb
I think ambulances got a loophole on that law which is crazy bc they are pretty much the main ones who need to be regulated.;jkcvf4p;1qnxb1bf;eisys8fb
Haha yep. When I worked at Cigna I remember reading we had a claims denial rate somewhere around 40%. The person denying your doctors orders was a 22 year old with no college degree referencing a flow chart.;jkc8pn8;f5n2x;elkbj
How is it the insurance companies fault the hospital was wrong about what was covered?;jkc3jsc;58xk8;elkbj
The person you replied to mentioned DORA so I’m thinking Colorado. CO is great in that it had a 3x damage cap (including the original amount claimed) for bad faith insurance denials.;jkd76ke;56dnf;elkbj
It’s so fucking ridiculous. Especially bc he has to have them. Both his parents died within a year of each other from Colon cancer. We had already met his deductible and out of pocket earlier in the year so we knew for a fact everything was covered. We told them obviously we would have gone to a stand alone clinic if we knew it wouldn’t be covered at the hospital. What idiot would choose to pay out of pocket for a covered procedure? Such bullshit.;jkd55gt;n8py6;uf0p9h27
My husband didn’t pay a hospital bill because it was 50k (after insurance) they just went to court and had his wages garnished (he was able to lower the amount eventually).;jkct0ig;ix3y5t8;8kceswi8
I didn't do it on PURPOSE.  I was actually paying what I could on time and my bill went to collections anyway. (Didn't know that could happen). They did eventually settle for a discounted amount though not as big a discount as you got. I only got a 10% discount on one bill.;jkcu3j4;3wwyd;8kceswi8
What dietary adjustments could help other than don’t eat junk food sugar?;jkd3pil;ok925;59w709zi
Or fly to Cancun for the weekend and get an MRI for $800 all inclusive.;jkcwsx0;4pp0p3w;e4fyk
Yeah. OP said when they went in for the appointment they were told insurance denied the authorization..I would've rescheduled til they got it approved.;jkcl5ar;4dm1wymi;5avbn6vd
Neither does the insurance company.  No really.   The plan coverage is determined by what the employer wants to offer the worker.  I’ve seen some plans that cover the slightest sneeze at 100% and some that were a total joke.  It’s all on what your employer wanted to offer.;jkcoa3f;zu0l2;5avbn6vd
The hospitals aren't specifically to blame in this instance but these gigantic healthcare networks that own thousands of hospitals around the country are not innocent in this jacked-up system we have.;jkd5crj;40zhaozlk;5avbn6vd
Not disputing that. However when you go the hospital for xyz reasons and they order an MRI do you have the ability to check yourself out and going somewhere cheaper?;jkcrfyc;2oa7uiq5;qj4xf
I've had medical imaging done many times at hospitals they take outside appointments if your doctor is in-network with them.  You don't go through the emergency room.;jkd89jy;z7hsnyv;qj4xf
No this is 100% an insurance company thing.  Your insurance negotiates rates with the radiologist group which may be separate from the hospital. If they don't come to terms they won't provide coverage. This usually happens when the radiology group is asking significantly more for an MRI than your local imaging center. I can 1 million percent promise you that the Radiologist group doesn't intentionally not carry that insurance because if insurance isn't involved they don't get paid anything at all for services rendered 9 times out of 10 except from collections which is pennies on the dollar. u/AntarcticFox in the future call your insurance prior to any medical service and get it approved if it's not an emergent issue. Unfortunately if this debt is already sold to collections I wouldn't bother with the insurance company There is literally nothing they can do once the debt has been sold.  Start researching how to negotiate with collections.  They probably paid $.02 per dollar of your debt so they'll sometimes take $.10 per dollar or $700. Make sure the negotiation includes removal of the debt from your credit history and get that in writing.Good luck!;jkcuz1m;hkpiv;3lq2p
Isn’t private equity exactly why angry mobs with pitchforks and torches were invented?;jkd72ol;8hw4n;3lq2p
Shi-na-gigans. Sounds like a kaiju name.Godzilla vs Shinagigans.I'd watch it.;jkd6hgd;sthblhtg;h9qg8
Need to also consider your healthcare needs for the rest of the year and how your plan is structured.If you are expecting to meet your deductible for the year don't do this.  Try to get the MRI covered under insurance otherwise you're paying your full deductible plus another $300 for the imaging as opposed to having the MRI contribute towards your annual out-of-pocket max.;jkd2pdf;1dh4k;28639uoz
Outpatient elective radiology services are not the target of the no surprises act. It’s more for the scenario when you go for a service that is approved or no prior authorization required (like surgery ER visit childbirth etc) and an out of network provider is part of the care you receive there. You usually plan the MRI and it’s (unfortunately) the patients responsibility to schedule an MRI following the insurers’ rules.;jkchr06;1qnxb1bf;ix1ll
>Insurances can’t decide that a hospital is in-network but certain services at the hospital aren’t covered.Insurance doesn't decide what's in network and what's not. The network is established by contract and if the provider doesn't play ball in the contracting they're out of network.Network requirements are fairly consistent at a high level because most states have adopted the NAIC model law. The details about whether an particular network meets those high level requirements has more variation in it though because each states OIC makes that determination of what those high level requirements mean. The same theoretical network could be judged to be inadequate in one state and adequate in another.The specifics of whether hold harmless will apply depends on state law state regulation and the network contract. The no surprises provision in federal law generally only covers situations where the consumer has no capacity for choice like emergent conditions. It's worth looking into but it's not guaranteed here.;jkbzka6;4t8zt;ix1ll
I don’t recall the rate but I put some time in at UHC and the top-down company mantra was to work hard to get the claim paid within plan guidelines and keeping it all legal.   No flow charts just a lot of training on the tools we had and how to figure out why a claim denied how to look up the policy details and if there was anything remotely possible get the claim adjusted.  A great majority were flat out billing errors by the providers. Most were minor but some providers were just a hot mess all day long.;jkco01w;zu0l2;f5n2x
Because they designed and fought for this system in regulatory capture. It's overly complicated on purpose so mistakes are made and they can then deny payment. Insurance companies often can't even keep their own contract details straight. How are Drs offices supposed to be able to do that for all possible insurance providers.;jkc6dmy;3k1bcf2s;58xk8
That sucks. Sorry to hear it. I guess it is hospital dependent;jkcxdw6;8kceswi8;ix3y5t8
Read again - they did NOT tell me insurance denied the authorization. I obviously would not have gotten the MRI if I knew insurance wouldn't cover it;jkd55ka;6e2os;4dm1wymi
That’s part of emergency care and different Your normal imaging that’s part of a normal dr visit isn’t supposed to be done in a hospital;jkcx9we;qj4xf;2oa7uiq5
Once the debt is sold their recourse basically ends. There has been multiple cases of debt being dropped because of paperwork issues.Healthcare especially as they have to prove that You had that service at that time and that you owe them X which is hard when you cannot share that invo due to HIPPA 🤣;jkcxypx;yhqkt;hkpiv
Some medical providers use collection agencies that don't report.  Others use collection agencies that haven't purchased the debt but rather are just trying to collect on behalf of the hospital.  So sometimes the practice can call back the debt.;jkd2ftp;hgdeb;hkpiv
"No I go to a neurology center where they try to funnel everyones images and infusions into the onsite ""hospital"" They charge insane rates for the mris and infusions and you dont realize that your insurance doesn't cover it till its too late.Their imaging center and infusion center is operated under a different llc which is somehow designated as a hospital even though its no different from any other infusion center or imaging place.Straight up stealing from vulnerable patients through convoluted technicalities they are in no place to navigate";jkd7wp4;h5lxt;hkpiv
OP didn’t say he was outpatient. It’s possible this was an inpatient MRI in which case it would apply. OP should clarify.;jkcnqq2;32r9w;1qnxb1bf
Can we acknowledge that getting a test that can save your life because you’re experiencing symptoms should never be considered “elective”? Like I’m going to elect to maybe die by ignoring this because I can’t afford it. We live in a pretty pathetic system.;jkcu6hz;1aobt95k;1qnxb1bf
Yeah Health insurers can’t just choose to deny a claim for funsies. They have to have specific reasons. I worked for a health insurer a while ago and they implemented new claim adjudication logic incorrectly and denied a bunch of legit claims. They went back and paid all impacted claims whether they should or not bc they would have gotten in deep shit w regulators otherwise.;jkcuxlv;1ucm47o;zu0l2
"In cases like this the term ""elective"" doesn't mean ""optional"" it means that it's scheduled in advance and isn't an immediate life-or-death emergency. At the beginning of the pandemic hospitals were putting off elective surgeries and things like removing cancerous tumors were considered elective.";jkcvk1f;sku54a0;1aobt95k
Elective doesn't mean optional it means that the urgency is low enough that you had time to schedule it in advance and choose the provider.;jkcvosu;7shk7;1aobt95k
Thanks for explaining!;jkcw3j8;1qnxb1bf;sku54a0
**Introduction:**  Hi all two years ago I made this: https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/lkivav/cost\_analysis\_of\_2\_years\_at\_community\_college/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3 post detailing the costs associated with obtaining my associate’s degree from a California community college. I am currently in the process of graduating from a Cal State school with my bachelor’s degree so I figured I would do an updated version for my expenses in the last two years.   A little background on me I graduated high school in 2019 as a relatively competitive student and attended a local community college for 2 years while living at home. In 2021 I transferred to a California State School where I have spent the last 2 years working towards my bachelor’s. I am graduating with a bachelor’s degree in a STEM field and I have a job lined up for post graduation. Counting all expenses related to obtaining my associates degree but excluding costs not directly tied to my education such as living expenses my associates degree cost me $709.88 USD. How I got this number is detailed in my previous post.   In this post I will break down the expenses incurred during my 2 years at a California State University. I will be including all major expenses directly related to my education including transfer expenses books tuition transportation and graduation expenses but excluding major expenses not directly related to my education such as living expenses and car maintence. All expenses will be listed in USD. I am fortunate that my parents allowed me to live at home and not pay rent for the duration of my college education. I live and attend school in a HCOL area so I saved at least 40k by living at home as opposed to on campus housing or living off campus with roommates. This is not something that is available to all students so I am grateful for this assistance.   **Transfer Expenses:**  First off I needed to transfer from my community college to a university in order to finish my Bachelor’s degree. I only applied to one school which is part of why my transfer expenses are so low.  I also did not participate in graduation for my community college which meant I did not have to worry about buying a cap/gown/etc. In total to transfer I paid:  Transcript Services: $27.05  Application Cost: $70   Acceptance Deposit: $150\*  Orientation Fee: $87.38  \*This amount is applied to tuition costs in the student’s first semester which will be reflected in lower first semester tuition below   **Tuition and Fees:**   This is by far the largest contributor to my overall expenses. I do not qualify for any government aid and I did not win any scholarships over the last two years meaning I paid full price for every semester of tuition. I am originally from California so I paid in-state tuition. The figures below are the total paid for a full time undergraduate student including mandatory “fees” for things like student health services.   Tuition Fall 2021: $3721.11 - $150 Acceptance Deposit = $ 3571.11  Tuition Spring 2022: $ 3721.11  \*Tuition Summer 2022: $1867.32  Tuition Fall 2022: $3721.11  Tuition Spring 2023: $3721.11  \*I did choose to take one summer class for an exorbitant price so expenses could be reduced further by sticking to fall/spring semesters. This summer class was not something I had to do but rather a class I really wanted to take that was only offered during summer.   Over my two years at my university tuition was never raised which is pretty wild considering how prices for other services have changed over the past 2 years.   **Books and Supplies:**  The majority of my textbooks were bought used or rented digitally. The most expensive textbook I purchased cost $143.40 the cheapest non-free textbook purchased was $4.95. This category also includes online programs required to do/turn in homework. Fortunately most of my professors were very aware of textbook prices and made an effort to choose low cost or no cost options. “Supplies” is a catch all term for writing utensils notebooks and other physical supplies I used in classes.   Textbooks: $522.48  Online Programs: $151.50  Supplies: $87.29   **Transportation:**   This section has the least precise data because I didn’t track exactly how much of each tank of gas was used for commuting to school vs. other obligations. My Fall 2021 and Summer 2022 terms were fully remote so involved no transportation costs. I commuted to campus 2-4 times a week during the Spring 2022 Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 semesters. Cost of fuel is napkin math here.   Gas: $576  Parking Permits: $557.50  I am not including vehicle depreciation because my car is worth approximately $0 to everyone except for me.  **Graduation Expenses:**  Some items in this category are technically unnecessary as graduation attendance is not required to graduate. I am going to be attending graduation but I chose the cheapest options for all required purchases. I am borrowing a cap and gown instead of purchasing one and I am not purchasing any school rings/alumni swag/etc. I am purchasing a custom diploma frame because I am picky and want a nice one.   Graduation Application Fee: $59   Graduation Regalia (tassels sash stole): $75.39  Diploma Frame: $108.41  **Total Expenses by Category:**  Transfer Expenses: $334.43  Tuition and Fees: $16601.76  Books and Supplies: $761.27  Transportation: $1133.50  Graduation: $ 242.80  **Total : $19073.76**   **Conclusions:**  My two years of education at a California State University cost a total of $19073.76 with no financial aid scholarships or grants. Accounting for my two years at community college which cost $709.88 my total out of pocket cost for my bachelor’s degree was $19783.64 between 2019-2023. I accomplished this through a combination of my family generously allowing me to live rent free at home my amazingly affordable community college and my own die-hard frugality.  My college experience was not glamorous easy or especially exciting but it was affordable and educational. I can say with certainty that I am graduating on better financial footing than many of my peers and I wouldn’t change my experience for anything. Choosing to do the boring responsible thing while in college has set me up to enjoy the next 40+ years of my life as a (hopefully) high earner with no college debt. Hopefully this is helpful in some way and I'll be happy to answer any questions about my experiences!;13i9vhy;40a74213;
One big thing here is that you managed to complete your bachelor's in 2 years after transferring. I know many people who need to take longer especially if they don't know exactly what they want to major in. Congrats on your journey and best of luck in your future job!;jk95i34;57s2m8s3;40a74213
I’m honestly kind of shocked at how little tuition is at CSU. I live in Florida and our tuition here is shockingly low—I paid $17k total for my master’s degree at University of Central Florida—but I expected the CSU system to have higher tuition. I’m curious if the UC system is similarly inexpensive.;jk9go6r;g5c1r;40a74213
Very similar experience. It took me like 3 years at CC cause finding classes that made an “optimal schedule” was challenging.     Same issue at 4 year but got out in 6 years total and paid similar since I graduated in 2017.     CC was one of the best things I did. All my friends are even more high achieving than me and I’m an engineer. Most proud of my chemistry lab partner. She’s about to graduate from medical school.     My only complaint about CC is that it’s really easy to be misguided. My mom was a teacher at the time and had an above average understanding of the system but I still could have gotten out sooner if I was better informed.;jk9rwir;6ncjz;40a74213
Moral of story is you picked a sensible and reasonably priced school to avoid high student debt. Most don’t. I too am a CSU grad without student debt.;jk9ylus;13z4hb;40a74213
Dang CSU got expensive! I graduated a decade ago and don't think I would even be able to afford the same school anymore particularly the housing costs in the Bay. (SFSU).Congratulations on graduation! Many never make it that far or as quickly as you did.;jk9ptr1;9j3kv6d4;40a74213
For contrast I graduated from Cal Poly SLO in 1992. Tuition and fees I paid were < $400/quarter out of pocket. No financial aid.;jk9ipk8;15zvqm;40a74213
I was very similar. 2 years at a junior college then I did 3 at CSU. Not all my classes transferred so I was on the 5 year plan.;jk9pe2r;96m85e8m;40a74213
Note that many but not all California CC participate in the California College Promise Program. A resident full-time and first-time student will receive 2 years **free** tuition. No income caps like financial aid. It’s just free.Some UCs have the Transfer Admission Guarantee program which is like it says **guaranteed** transfer from CC if academic conditions are met (namely reasonable GPA and coursework). CSU has a similar program for guaranteed transfer with CC Associates Degree. So a 2 year CC plus 2 year UC or CSU path in California is cheap and has a high chance of admission for a Bachelors Degree from an excellent school.;jkbol82;jarpc;40a74213
Damn csu’s got expensive. Dropped out of a UC back in ‘09 because I didn’t know what to do in the future and felt like I was just wasting money. Back then tuition was like 3500 ish maybe per quarter.;jk9rhnv;grubu;40a74213
Did you apply for financial aid during your time in CC? I got all of classes covered and I transferred to a UC and they paid for all of my tuition as well. I have zero student debt;jka584x;8s3kt;40a74213
Congrats OP. You’re playing the long game well. Similarly I graduated from a CSU about six years ago after transferring from a community college with only about $15K in debt. The details are a bit different as I was an older student who qualified for more financial aid (max pell grants free tuition) and won a few small scholarships as a returning student but I used it to my advantage. Moral of the story is if you’re a young person who is on the fence about going away for four years of college or going the CC route I’ve rarely met anyone who later on in life regretted going to CC route. You’ll thank yourself for it later on in life.;jkaytj4;4oah0ks0;40a74213
This was my experience as well approximately 20 years ago. The CC tuition was $11/unit and the CSU was $121. I lived at home didn’t buy a parking pass bought my textbooks used on half.com or the foreign editions which were always cheaper and spent right around $10K;jkbgqx7;i5boz;40a74213
"Nice write up! I was 5 years community college (ew writing that) 2 years CSU graduated debt free $5500 loan paid off prior for my last year Reason I was at CC so long was initially a nursing major only problem at my CC was everyone was in Stem and everyone was required to take the basic ass biology only problem? (Took my 2nd year 2nd semester just to get in) because of how impacted (waitlist 25+) the classes were by the time i could register.I was taking 16-19 units a semester plus winter and summer while working and by year 3 i was depressed and burnt out. Passed my classes for Core bios B and 2 C’s all my friends were out of state partying and set to graduate the 4th yearMy 4th year was taking extra classes while applying for nursing programs. However i screwed myself. I had everything done finally when applying except the B and 2 C’s weighted for 13 units and made me like under a 2.0 for the core bio courses so even though i was doneA lot of programs wouldn’t even consider me with my overall GPA being a 3.35-3.5 i can’t recall My only option was Go to a new community college and lose all my priority to retake the classes (since i passed them) and do better to have it then “average out my grade” all just to then again have the chance to apply but not even guarantee me getting inI said screw it; I’m a business guy anyhow and did my 4th and 5th all my finance and math courses and transferred 2019 to CSU while living at home and commutingOnly for me to enjoy 1.5 semesters then covid hit. I had a nice routine and enjoyed somewhat of a college experience just in better facilities and being at a packed school to meet people only for me to get kicked out during covid and move to my real dad’s home and finish in my room.Didn’t walk didn’t do graduation photos none of it …i was just doneFinished 2021 May hired at my current job july 2021 $65k a year going into year 2 but i do plan to make the jump to corporate side to make more money to afford SoCal HCOLFinally met someone so just dating 3-4 months in but it’s going well and she just graduated from a masters program and now applying for jobs I’m happy I’ve traveled a lot during those 7 years and wouldn’t change it but it did shape me into a better stronger person at the end of the day";jkbkrjg;53l1w0w2;40a74213
Why no grants? Did you just opt out of the fasfa? I took the Community College route and got a stem bachelors from UC Davis without paying a single dollar out of pocket. They actually gave *me* money each time aid rolled around.I admire your ability to pay cash for your degree but strongly advise other prospective students to look into grants and scholarships. The fasfa saved me around 50k from UC tuition alone..;jk8qvmx;174a4y;40a74213
"Just to point out - this is VERY far from a NORMAL experience props to OP for figuring out how to play the system.nobody should read anything more into this other then ""One student who got super lucky managed to get his degree in 2 years"".&#x200B;for comparison - in Pennsylvania 1 COURSE at Local Community College cost more then 700$";jkad771;72yvl;40a74213
Thank you! I think community college is especially great for people who need some time to sort out their major. I loved my time at community college and it gave me a low stress environment to sort out what I really wanted.;jk9gx3n;40a74213;57s2m8s3
It’s a requirement to get your bachelors in 2 years after transferring;jkc1pdt;9fe199u;57s2m8s3
When I did the same transfer many many years back I found the CC was harder than the 4 year.;jkawbl8;135879;57s2m8s3
The UC system is definitely significantly more expensive that CSU’s. From a google search it looks like average in state tuition for a UC is $13752 while a CSU is only $5742.;jk9hmd6;40a74213;g5c1r
For what its worth despite the UC system being more expensive most low income people get a full ride. If your family makes less than $80000/year you don't have to pay any tuition. The UCs gave me so much aid I did not have to pay any tuition rent food or transportation costs;jkbdmxv;34mmigsy;g5c1r
CSU is really reasonable. The housing expense is probably the biggest differentiator because generally housing is fairly expensive in California. My wife and I both commuted and graduated with no debt although we did miss out on a bit of the college experience. UC is a little more but still not horrific considering many are world class universities.;jkax0e3;135879;g5c1r
I am a huge advocate for community college! Admittedly I was very lucky to have an excellent counselor at my CC who made sure I had the tools and information I needed to succeed.;jk9t6hc;40a74213;6ncjz
I didn't believe you at first because I graduated from Cal Poly SLO about 10 years ago and paid several thousand for tuition but then I looked it up and low and behold you are right. They have been raising costs much faster than inflation costs.https://www.collegecalc.org/colleges/california/california-polytechnic-state-university-san-luis-obispo/;jk9ougk;orl9iurb;15zvqm
I graduated in 1999. When I started in 1994 tuition had just gone up to $751 a quarter and students were pissed lol. I just looked and the average cost is about $10k with room and board. I feel for students these days.;jkbo04w;12d4rk;15zvqm
5 year plan is still plenty respectable getting all upper division classes done in 2 years is quite a feat! My transfer was relatively smooth and I still had semesters with 17-18 units to finish on time.;jk9qdm6;40a74213;96m85e8m
I was actually part of the promise program at my CC which is part of why my costs were so low! It’s a great program that I am so glad I was able to participate in.;jkbr5i7;40a74213;jarpc
I received free tuition for both years at community college through a program hosted by the CC. I did not qualify for any state or federal aid so the rest was paid out of pocket.;jka7ubx;40a74213;8s3kt
Thank you! Glad to hear that it worked out for you and that you don’t regret it. I hope I can say the same in a few years!;jkb6wjl;40a74213;4oah0ks0
I filled out the fafsa every year of college but my family income meant I never received any aid. I would still advise filling out the fafsa to all current and prospective college students but for me personally it made no difference in my financials.;jk8rbys;40a74213;174a4y
"I agree that my experiences certainly aren't ""normal"" but I don't think that they are entirely impossible to replicate especially for a California resident. California community colleges cost $46 per unit which works out to $2760 for 60 units. That's an associate's degree for \~3k even without any financial aid. I paid full price at my CSU which is much more that most students pay (75% of students at my school receive some form of financial aid). The obvious money saver in my case is being able to live at home for free which I understand is not possible for many. Also to clarify I did take 4 years to get my degree two at CC and two at a CSU. It’s unfortunate to hear that CC's are so expensive in other areas of the country because I definitely wouldn't have been able to achieve this without the affordability of my local CC.";jkafklx;40a74213;72yvl
This is weirdly almost exactly my experience.   I went to community college in CA and paid nothing the entire time (actually was net positive about 5 grand from pell grants).  I transferred to a CSU in a LCOL area my tuition was completely paid for by the Cal Grant and I lived off of a mix of the remaining pell grant and student loans. It took me 2.5 years to graduate and I worked part time and graduated with $19k in student loan debt which is now paid off.;jkazdx3;f6gtaia;72yvl
Damnit I hate reading shit like this. “Got super lucky.”  Fuck that shit. OP worked damned hard and smartly. Don’t try and short change their accomplishment by saying it was luck.;jkbtjpd;8co9g;72yvl
From my experience this is pretty normal if you're a CA resident going to in-state schools. Maybe some people might take an extra semester or two to get their bachelors if required courses are full but still similar. I'm not sure how the CC route works outside the state though.;jkcchhr;57s2m8s3;72yvl
and it's also cheaper! pre-req's are all the same in my opinion so why pay more $$$ at a traditional college when you can do those same classes at a 'discounted rate'. This is what I did and then I transferred elsewhere!;jk9tal3;1xnjs0xa;40a74213
While more expensive I know that they give near proportionally increased financial aid compared to CSU's. So if you were getting near max financial aid from FAFSA UC's can be an equally good financial option.;jk9lpwe;q5tjq;40a74213
When I went to grad school in Michigan in 2009 one credit hour cost about as much as a whole term when I was at Cal Poly.;jkc6qrm;15zvqm;12d4rk
I don't think they were trying to short change...I think they were pointing out that there are other states that don't have such a great opportunity. I grew up on the east coast and the CC route wasn't much of an option for me (limited CC and didn't like the colleges I could transfer to) though I know multiple people from CA who went the CC to UC route. It really is a great opportunity that many people in other states don't have especially with the range of schools available to transfer to and people in CA are lucky to have it. That being said OP has totally earned their success! My partner is also going this route (just got accepted into his dream school after multiple years in CC in both CA and CO) and I'm just so impressed.;jkd1qkw;9g11j;8co9g
That’s if the transferred units count to your major.;jkafoqv;6biij;1xnjs0xa
"My mother - who is approaching 80 & in Southern Oregon has a 1300 square foot single family house with a possibly 29 year old roof. No known leaks but starting to find shingles on the ground. She's not frivilous with money but limited income - about 2200/month and a few hundred additional one of my much older brother's helps with. House itself is on a mortgage but kind of a dream deal - the total pmt with escrow is just over $750/month. i.e. far less than an apartment would be. She just paid for a new AC in cash (old one died) and furnace on credit (which was old but functional - I can see psychologically why she did both) and is down to limited funds.  The plan for the roof seems to be non existant. I don't see any home repair low-income/elderly resources that would apply where she is (in city limits but a smaller city in S. Oregon) but may be missing them. I myself am in a decent spot by peronalfinance standards.  That said I don't love the idea of paying for a new roof (i.e. taking money out of my family & kid - just the principle of it) but - that or let the top of the house just rot eventually; seems like the best option.Am thinking maybe a cheaper reshingling which would last less long but...eh long enough? Thoughts?";13ib8c1;1k8r6i6f;
Pay for the roof and have her agree to a lien on the house so you will be paid when the home sells  in return. That way you get it back out of her equity when it sells no matter how it is divided up. Check the rules but you may even get your share before medicaid does if you have your lien on there first. I believe they get paid in order of age within tranches. If she is still able to stay in the house safely this seems like a no-brainer against the cost of a retirement home or rented space. That roof will have to be replaced to sell the house anyway so you may as well do it. Then decide next steps based on current home maintenance needs. If she can't stay in the house safely then you need to put a roof on the house or include a roof credit in the sale of the home and start packing her crap to get her into some form of living that better fits her and will transition her onto medicaid pay when the time comes.;jk95273;ofo5x;1k8r6i6f
If the damage is coming from wind or any insurance covered issue why not file an insurance claim? I doubt the 29 yo roof was without some kind of covered damage. Now I’m in Texas and we get lots of hail so a roof to last more than 7-8 years is rare.;jk9a3fx;wmhnv;1k8r6i6f
"Sadly it appears that Oregon's program that would help is out of funds.  You can try Rebuilding Together (used to be called Christmas in April).

Go to the shingling companies websites and find certified contractors in the area.  Look at their references.  Some will insist on the dog and pony show tell you that you need the super duper whatever give you a ""discount"" for an immediate order or for shingles they have in stock.  Whatever.  The dog and pony people are probably not the roofer for you.Tell them you want the price.  Bottom line no nonsense.  And if your mother is like mine she may trust the first person to knock on her door.You want the 3 tab 20 year shingles not the architectural ones or lifetime ones.

"Are you a handy person who would want to do this? If it's a smaller ranch style house with a couple roof planes it's an easy weekend job for an able bodied person and a helper or two.Roofing is a trade with a large disparity of skill requirements depending on the structure and type of roofing required.  A skilled standing seam roofer is more like a high end carpenter than they are like a shingler.  Shingles take very little skill to actually put on the speed in which you can install the shingles correctly is where the skill is but that shouldn't matter to you in this case. There's a saying in the industry that ""Everybody who loses their job is now a roofer or painter"" implying that it's really not that hard. Being comfortable working with heights is the ""Great Filter"" of the roofing trade.  Edit: If you do decide to hire someone be sure to get quotes and actual proof of insurance from multiple contractors/roofers. I've seen countless older people pay 2-3x what they should have for lower end shingle jobs.";jk9cqq8;sam7w;1k8r6i6f
Not trying to be insensitive but how expensive does a roof need to be on a 1300 square foot home? It would prob cost less than say $7000. I would just pay for it and hope that’s all of the financial aid you’ll need to put forth for a while. A HELOC is also an option. If your mother has a low income then another potential option (as someone else mentioned) is to look into government subsidized apartments for the elderly and ask to place your mother on their waitlist. Selling the house wouldn’t factor into it much since they base eligibility mostly on annual income not assets. The assets could probably be placed in a trust.;jkaaj0u;dqbupsse;1k8r6i6f

Transfer on death deeds absolutely do not avoid a Medicaid estate recovery claim in Oregon. The statute that authorized TOD deeds specifically built in an 18 month creditor claim period and Oregon's Medicaid estate recovery unit is one of the most aggressive in the country.

I have a living trust where the house title is in my name (daughter) but mom has rights to live there until she dies.  We set it up about 7 years ago to hopefully not lose the house when her health fails.  I just read an average rate is around $75000 for ONE year in a nursing home!  Yikes!  She only has around $20000 a year income.  In just 2 years she would blow through a lifetime of savings.  She does not have any investments just savings/CDs.  So far she can live alone but is 88 years old so who knows how much time she has left or how her health will be.;jkcpmu2;8ebkeryi;dxszs
Yes they do depreciate them but there’s depreciation recapture as long as the work is done. If a roof is $30k your first check might only be $22k. And let’s say you have a $4k deductible. That leaves an additional $4k that is recoverable once work is completed and evidence is sent to your insurer. Of course every policy and state is different. This is my very recent experience.;jk9iodg;wmhnv;f2fbf
The previous owners of my home replaced a 60 year old roof completely covered by insurance due to storm damage. If it's damaged for a covered reason it's covered.;jk9fc9v;uwq6sa4s;1k8r6i6f
Insurance pays for it minus the deductible. Usually 1% for wind/hail. This most recent roof (and gutters) only cost me $4.5k.;jk9fq7x;wmhnv;klfpf
Most reputable suppliers have a boom (essentially a small crane) that can bring the pallet to the roofline for you to pull off and stack so you never even have to carry shingles up a ladder. It's almost guaranteed there is an ABC Supply within delivery distance.  Weight can be a concern when going over old shingles on newish houses. Old houses were generally built for slate so they can handle a few layers of shingles.  (It's rare I get to put all this roofing knowledge to use on here lol);jk9oq5n;sam7w;zirj3
I’m sure location also plays a large part in costs. I paid $14k for a new roof on a 2800 sq ft house and the roof has quite a few high peaks so it wasn’t an easy job. My MIL just paid $7k for her 1500 sq ft house (same company). Either way as someone mentioned best to get several bids. Bids can vary greatly. One company quoted us $28k.;jkcu4v1;dqbupsse;aan3eyzs
odd. I built a 26x30 garage and got quotes for both metal and shingle. Metal was 1/2 as much.;jkajyxb;w3cff3lb;160phv
yup. The labor costs is what makes them so much cheaper since you can install them quickly and dont have to remove the old shingles.;jkaka8j;w3cff3lb;3rv7sso3
maybe its geographical. My metal roof was 1/2 the cost of shingles.;jkak3y7;w3cff3lb;1k8r6i6f
If you pay for the roof you write a contract that pays you back for that before the proceeds are split with your siblings.  It's only fair unless you also pay for the roof three ways;jk91w5z;pkcr9;1k8r6i6f
If she needs to pay for something but can't afford to pay for it well there's no magic answer my friend.;jk92tus;okpso;1k8r6i6f
OP i would look into this... She may have a hefty USDA subsidy recapture tax if its left to you as an inheritance. It may be better to HECM now and figure out what the recapture is if you are concerned about future inheritance. There may be a bit less than you are thinking in equity already. Quick glance looks like 50% of the appreciation may be the tax.;jk9lbrn;u2gyefrt;1k8r6i6f
Yeah this sounds like a different situation since I originally posted.;jkcrftd;vh0hg8k7;3qcfmw6g
She's 80 building equity isn't really the goal at this point.  She has a net worth plus retirement income. She may need to get at the equity in the house by selling it then use that money plus her retirement income to afford housing.The current house is NOT just $750 a month you have to include upkeep in your thinking. And if her retirement income isn't enough to maintain the house  it's got to go! She needs to figure out how to draw down living costs for her remaining years. Wealth building is for the young.(Edit: sorry reddit is lagging so I'm getting multiple posts trying to clean it up);jk935n5;21p5tczq;1k8r6i6f
But it isn’t $750/month. You have to calculate in repair and maintenance costs. That being said I got a HELOC to handle a new roof and other renovations.;jk92yna;r7c6o;1k8r6i6f
Plumbing or electrical are far more complicated. Not everyone is comfortable climbing on a roof though. It also is easier to have a large roofing crew come in and get it done in a day or two to protect the house. At a minimum if you’re comfortable on a ladder you could at least do some patching as needed. The cost is also going to be dependent on what is on there now. You can have max of 2 layers of singles. If by chance she only has 1 they could go overtop with a second round which is cheaper than removing and replacing.;jk93ehb;zuvox;1k8r6i6f
Listen I will NEVER try to devalue a person's trade and call it unskilled or whatever but if money is the limiting factor it's definitely not outside of the realm of reality that a person can do some research and get it done. For reference my father and I redid the roof on my childhood home that my brother lives in now about 20 years ago and it has never had a problem.Do your research find out the tool costs whether it's renting or buying and decide what's best for your situation. There's a contractor on YouTube called Home Renovision DIY. He generally covers more traditionally DIY projects but he may have something about roofing as well.;jk9347b;zwij0;1k8r6i6f
The works sucks! It's not complicated. It's just back breaking. A 1300 ft roof is very doable for anyone that is capable of swinging a hammer. If you need to replace the sheeting it's more of a pain but again not complicated. Just unpleasant.;jk9o4st;62qgg;1k8r6i6f
Can break it into sections.   Strip it use ice and water shield where needed.   After stripping and reshingling a section you'll be tired.   The hardest part is flashing/valleys.;jkcrxna;aan3eyzs;1k8r6i6f
She's not able to pay for upkeep on the house - if that roof gets any damage insurance isn't going to cover it at almost 30 years.Check the cost of retirement communities in the area vs. the value of her house it might be worth it.;jka9dfx;47kuj;1k8r6i6f

This is not always true. My father had 40 year old siding on his home and they only covered it partially because it was well past its life cycle and maintenance is expected of homeowners.;jk9k2am;bgbb8;uwq6sa4s
If *all* roofs only last 7-8 years due to hail damage *you are* paying for it through insurance premiums.I think Florida is like that too.;jk9ivfv;dudzq;wmhnv
I have seen mini converor belts too but no idea if you can rent one. End of day 1300 Sq ft single story is about as easy a roofing job you can hope for.I helped my dad in my teens so was easier to haul them up a ladder.   I remember an older Hispanic guy helping was in his 60s hauling up two at a time.;jka3i7q;zirj3;sam7w
Use a lien for this that way they get paid no matter how her final days go. Medicaid won't care about a family contract. They won't be able to say no to a lien.;jk95das;ofo5x;pkcr9
I've had that thought too though:Middle brother has also been contributing monthly for quite a while so at that point factor that in as well.Which would leave out older brother (ie the not responsible one). Which is fair but haven't you heard your corporate DEI officer talk about equity?  Not even joking look how big people are on that for strangers -  thoughts of equity are going to be stronger with family.;jk934oi;1k8r6i6f;pkcr9
"I'm familar - yes 50% appreciation or total subsidy whicher is less.Thus the equity - ""true"" payback is so little that a reverse mortgage payout wouldn't cover it.  And was thinking any lender simply wouldn't want to get involved.";jk9pscu;1k8r6i6f;u2gyefrt
Also lack of maintenance can *very* quickly drop the residual equity in the home. One bad roof leak in a room she doesn't use can take tens of thousands off equity or worse and quickly.;jk9lh8n;dudzq;21p5tczq
True not just 750.Though rent is substantially more. I don't see her being able to pay a HELOC for this while still paying off the HVAC work.  Edit:  d'oh had no idea how a HELOC worked. I withdraw my statement.;jk93gt3;1k8r6i6f;r7c6o
"I'm not there to check but I'm imagining only 1. I think the roof is the original. That said if it's original it's 29 years old. Is reshingling ""OK"" at that age?";jk93w71;1k8r6i6f;zuvox
"Exactly. Bad cycle.  People pay more for insurance they ""deserve"" a roof get one every few years.  Insurance companies have to charge more to cover said roofs. Eventually carriers just leave the state because it isn't worth it to do business.";jk9u4d6;291qizep;dudzq
Oh Texas is paying for it. They are DEFINITELY paying for it. Through the nose and then some. Their premiums are... well... Through roof!;jkajt0n;ofo5x;dudzq
Yes of course you are. That’s the only way insurance would actually work.;jk9jcr8;wmhnv;dudzq
Was on a roof a few years ago unloading shingles from the conveyor.  The lumberyard had a truck equipped with one. Nice house nice asphalt driveway.  Hydraulic hose on the conveyor blew and started spraying the driveway;jkcr6kb;aan3eyzs;zirj3
"You're not really taking away from your older brother. Let's say the value of the house as-is in $90k. That's 30k for each brother. You put a new roof on and now the house is worth $100k. You're only asking that before the estate is split that that $10k be repaid to you first. Your brother would still get his 1/3rd and probably more because of the appreciation of the house and not having water damage. And I don't think anyone would fault you or mom for the brothers that cared for mom receiving a slightly larger share of the inheritance.     Also ""Equity"" in the DE&I sense means offering job/business opportunities to people who have been traditionally disenfranchised it's not really applicable in the sense of ""Home Equity"".";jk96q29;a838c;1k8r6i6f
As long as you calculate true cost. My HELOC has a draw period of 10 years where you only pay interest (I’m paying more but do not have to). In addition she could use the HELOC to consolidate the debt. Write off a check from the HELOC to pay off the HVAC outright.;jk941cw;r7c6o;1k8r6i6f
probably need to remove the old and put new tarpaper on and re-roof;jk97hnu;13s8hi;1k8r6i6f
No not really. Insurance as intended is to cover unexpected events.You replacing your roof on your insurance company's dime every 7 years is _not_ unexpected therefore insurance shouldn't cover it.If it truly needs replacing every 7 years drop policyholders that can't prove the roof was replaced every 7 years.;jkac529;dudzq;wmhnv
Equity vs equality is how I meant it in DEI terms. I mean she really wouldn't be comfortable splitting anything other than evenly.  But perhaps that's a conversation.;jk97kmn;1k8r6i6f;a838c
That's great info. So could do 10 years and if still erm...alive refinance into another HELOC at that point seemingly. Thus the only cost is interest plus loss of equity down the road - but I'm clearly not the sort looking for an inheritance anyway. Do I have that right?  I was shockingly ignorant of HELOC loans until about 5 minutes ago.;jk94vkt;1k8r6i6f;r7c6o
You obviously don’t live in north Texas. We have some of the highest insurance rates outside of Florida because of our hail.;jkae4u4;wmhnv;dudzq
After the first 10 years you have 20 years to repay. Principal and interest payments are now required but because they’re spread out over so long payments may still be low. You may be able to request an extension of the draw period or refinance the debt. Pay attention to terms of the loan. It may require the balance to be paid on her death.;jk95og9;r7c6o;1k8r6i6f
Reading a bit more on this... it's a semi-clever way to make sure homeowners with mortgages always have money to pay for new roofs by amortizing the cost across the lifetime of your insurance policies. AKA: making sure the banks never lose money.;jkaeudl;dudzq;wmhnv
I took my wife to the er twice in the last month both times because of low hemoglobin. The first time she went in with what was well below life threatening and when they released her she was just at life threatening. The second time we took her in was also for low hemoglobin levels. The second time they got her hemoglobin up to a moderate level which isn’t great but her health is in a state where she can slowly regain her levels. That said me and my wife while not poor are in a financial hard place and are saddled with two big bills and do not qualify for financial help. So my question is is  there anything we could do that would legally speaking that would be able to help us seeing as they sent her home in bad condition the first time?;13i7feb;a10bhy3n;

"Well one thing you should do is get her a primary care physician so you don't use the ED in that manner. Or does she have a PCP? ED care is always going to be way more expensive than seeing a PCP. If she requires blood transfusions or iron infusions that can be done on an outpatient basis.   You can ask for a payment plan. Do you not have insurance? Not even ACA on the marketplace?  When she was discharged the first time what was the recommendation for care? Was it to follow up with a PCP? &#x200B;Also how did you know her hemoglobin was low? Did she have a blood test before going to the ED or was it at the ED? I'm a medical person wondering what you're going to do in the future as well. ED visits are just expensive even with insurance.";jk8fzpt;6g8a4faw;a10bhy3n
The ER's job is to stabilize not to treat once they determined your wife was stabilized they would have transferred elsewhere for care or discharged her home care to follow up with a regular doctor or specialist.  It sounds like they discharged her home.  After the first visit did they give the two of you any instructions such as she needs to take iron supplements and to follow up with her regular doctor and/or a hematologist?  Do you and your wife have insurance?  If not I would look into whether you qualify for medicaid as this can be retroactive and provide benefit to those ER visits.  If you do have insurance you can talk to the hospital about a payment plan to spread the costs of the bills out over a few years or if they offer financial assistance.  If they do offer assistance you will have to prove need by providing paystubs bank statements or similar documentation.;jk8ikh2;4f2ycuv7;a10bhy3n
"I assume with a Hgb that low twice in a month she is being followed  by a hem-onc (I am guessing she has cancer? If she does I can give you a pile of resources)?Blood transfusions are expensive as hell - i've had 6 of them all outpatient. They were 5k each time (bit I usually needed two bags of irradiated blood).If she has a medical condition sometimes the organizations for those conditions have financial assistance programs.Talk to the hospital and try to get a payment plan.Since you're concerned about her being sent home in ""bad condition"" - talk to her doctor and see what they think. Did she follow the discharge plan in the ER paperwork? Since the ER is there to stabilize - not manage or treat a condition.";jk8jdx0;47kuj;a10bhy3n
Call the hospital billing department and ask for an income and asset evaluation form to reduce the bill. Many hospitals have funding set aside for this specific situation. Do not assume your family makes too much money for help until you've gone through the process.It's annoying on principle but worth the phone call and time spent filling out and mailing back a form.Going forward if this isn't life threatening and the primary Care doctor or specialist isn't available go to urgent care. ZoomCare for example clearly states their prices for visits and the types of care they can provide. If you're struggling with a primary care availability urgent care clinics are also offering primary care services.ER's are primed for immediate critical/life saving care so they hit with everything to stabilize the patient. They do not waste precious time in careful consideration of what's been going on and what direction to go in to make the patient feel better. All those tests scans etc add up real fast.;jk8ljt7;bhzd5;a10bhy3n
Many hospitals will allow you to negotiate medical bills. We had a pretty hefty ER bill I called the financial assistance office and once we didn't qualify for assistance I offered them a settlement amount. I told them I could only afford about half the full amount and they agreed to accept that and zero out the remaining balance.;jk952nh;10w9ff;a10bhy3n

Read the entire bill front and back. Look out for where it tells you how to apply for financial assistance for the bill.  It has nothing to do with any public assistance program  just between you and the hospital.   Most have very generous assistance you just have to ask for it otherwise the bills just keep coming.;jk9dc1g;dz2scbyv;a10bhy3n
Ask for itemized bill! Hospitals will include extra charges or increase the cost of items without you knowing. For example if they gave you acetaminophen or ibuprofen they could charge you $500 a pill. With an itemized bill you can dispute unreasonable and unrealistic costs and have your bill reduced. Also workout a payment plan. Sorry for your tough times and hope you get better soon.;jk8slnf;qztza;a10bhy3n
Hospital financial assistance program and agree with others she needs Primary Care so the root cause of her problems are resolved.If her current PCP really needs three months for an urgent appointment find a new one.;jk8oisx;getfb;a10bhy3n
Mark bill as incorrect & ask that it be itemized. Errors are often discovered through itemization.;jk8x34v;d1d43p01;a10bhy3n
Since I haven't seen anyone else say it call the billing department for the ER. Ask them what can be done in most cases they will have a paid in full discount. The few times I've done this even with insurance I've gotten between 15% and 25% off the bill.;jk9gj1c;18zs1k5t;a10bhy3n
"Read the fine print on the bottom of your bill and see if they leave an address to contest the bill. Type out a polite short and concise objective statement denying that you feel you are responsible for the bill. Do not pay anything and wait- as it may constitute acceptance of the charges. Sometimes they get back to you sometimes they don't. Contact your PCP directly and leave a message that Hgb was low necessitating emergency room transfusions and that the ER instructed you to follow up in a timely fashion. They can squeeze you in; if not call different PCPs and tell them the same thing and someone will help you.";jkaa1td;bsjjs;a10bhy3n
People often get frustrated with the ED because they didn’t fix their problem but the ED is there to stabilize and make the decision whether to admit transfer or discharge the patient with instructions to follow up with PCP and/or a specialist. Coming from a clinical standpoint 6 years as an ER nurse you can have low hemoglobin and be stable with mild to no symptoms so it would make sense to discharge her if she wasn’t severely symptomatic after blood replacement granted the hemoglobin was low enough to need a transfusion and not actively hemorrhaging. Without knowing lab values and symptoms I can’t really say much more than that.As far as billing goes contact the billing department of the hospital ask for an itemized bill then after reviewing the bill see if they will negotiate. Might also reach out to local charities and churches to see if there’s something they might be to do granted if you make a decent income the the answer is likely to be no.;jkaw3eo;77bincrh;a10bhy3n
"Hospitals are required to have Charity Care programs since they are non-profits and get huge tax exemptions. Google your hospital + ""financial assistance"" and look for their pdf doc policy then look for a table that lists % of poverty level and patient discounts. Typically these will extend to up to 400% of poverty level so even if you think you might not qualify it's still best to look because the discounts can be considerable. If you make less than a certain amount the bill may be covered in its entirety.";jkb16mw;10qa1q1l;a10bhy3n
"Based on my experience the hospital billing department tries to dissuade patients from any compassionate care programs they might have and try to push the narrative that they will only write it off if you have Medicaid (I'm assuming you are in the US). I recommend calling back and trying with another representative--don't divulge specifics about your finances. Just tell them you are unable to pay this bill or set up an payment plan at this time and to provide you with alternate options. If I get someone unwilling to help I hang up and call another day. Likewise I would try researching on their website for any financial programs they offer. Also request copies of detailed billing statements also called superbills and review them to ensure they did not erroneously bill you for tests or procedures not actually provided at time of service. Also say they gave your wife Tylenol or something and charged $75 for it try and negotiate them down and argue you can easily get a whole bottle OTC for $10 etc. You can also call your health insurance provider and see if they'll go through the bill with you to determine if anything else can be further adjusted. In another example the hospital billing department can sometimes ""screw up"" the medical billing and you can ask for an audit of the bill. For example charging you for a Level 5 trauma emergency (i.e. gunshot heart attack chopped off limb etc) when you came in for something less severe (i.e. a bad flu norovirus dehydration etc.) Typically a nurse auditor will review and can adjust or reaffirm the charges.I'm going through something similar myself and if you find a compassionate care program based on their application requirements you may be asked to provide copies of items such as pay stubs tax return and a list of medical expenses as supporting documentation for their consideration. Good luck!";jkbugrs;3fzp9ak5;a10bhy3n
She did have a PCP but we could not get a appointment for less than three months out. She is already on an iron pill as well as gave a her another pill to help stop the bleeding they set her up an appointment for a gynecologist since the bleeding was excessive menstrual bleeding. We knew it was low because they tested her when we arrived first thing as she showed symptoms of severe anemia and the test came back at 3.5. As for insurance she is on her parents insurance they get through work still as she hasn’t graduated college and figured it would be a good way to save some money.;jk8kz0e;a10bhy3n;6g8a4faw
"tbh with Hgb so low twice in a month (OP said ""below life threatening"" - so I am thinking 4-5 for the first time) I am wondering if wife is being seen by a hematologist.";jk8jlzm;47kuj;6g8a4faw
Yes they do have payment plans and offer financial assistance but we do not qualify we make more that they allow. In all truthfulness I would be just fine but she also had a bad situation a year ago and I’m still paying on two other medical bills still so having 4 to pay on all at once makes it add up;jk8opeq;a10bhy3n;4f2ycuv7
The billing advice is good but as low as her hemoglobin was she would have been routed straight to the ED anyways. Most clinics and offices aren't equipped for blood transfusions.;jk8szyl;1q6e2t;bhzd5
This has been around the internet so many times but it is not true.  Asking for an itemized bill generally does not lower your bill.  You can use it to check for mistakes but unless they said you had surgery or imaging that did not occur you will not find items on there that can be removed to reduce your bill.  If the bill has been processed by insurance it should be reduced based on their negotiated rate if OP if insurance is paying any or any charges are not allowed.;jk8vc4l;4f2ycuv7;qztza
If she can’t get into her PCP within 3 months it’s time to find a new one. If her specific provider wasn’t available there should be at least someone else in the office who could see her within a day or two. Many clinics save “same day” appt slots for urgent visits. I’d shop around if you have that option.;jk8svge;55wu4o7w;a10bhy3n
I agree with the other commenter might need to find a new PCP. One time i messaged my PCP  via mychart and asked for an urgent care recommendation since my foot was injured i couldn't walk and i needed help. They told me that there was an available slot and i could come in. It seems to me they have a buffer on their schedule for urgent things.;jk98poi;103dsq;a10bhy3n
Skip the PCP and call the obgyn.;jk9txo8;nu4df5vg;a10bhy3n
She should have both a pcp and a gyn at her age.  One of those should have been able to see her for something semi-emergent.;jk9t3hy;3a250td4;a10bhy3n
Make sure you read the insurance policy and benefits if you decide to try for a baby for example. Typically that is not covered by a parent’s insurance.;jkapzkz;x6h2z;a10bhy3n
The first time she went in she had a 3.5 and they brought her up to 6.6. The second time it was 6.4 and they got her up to 8.8. She had an appointment with a new PCP and she recommended she see a hematologist.;jk8lpxx;a10bhy3n;47kuj
It seems to me that the underlying nonmedical issue to address is your insurance situation.;jk8wstm;wybacni;a10bhy3n
Payment plans are independent if income call them again. The best thing is for her to get a better insurance with lower deductible . Someone with type one diabetes will forever need a lot of care many times emergent so higher premiums will save you both a lot of money on the long run.;jka8oi9;s5yjhaj8;a10bhy3n
I'd really like it if at some point somebody with insurance who successfully challenged a bill with an itemized invoice did an AMA and had supporting documentation and could outline the entire process.;jk9epz6;2gx31ood;4f2ycuv7
I used to work for a health insurance company. I’d still ask for an itemized bill & if it’s super padded I’d forward it to the insurance company. Especially if it’s an in network provider. The insurance can decline things especially if they are mutually exclusive to the treatment like billing for a venipuncture to do blood work. They will have to write it off.;jk9ndvy;c5pv9js2;4f2ycuv7
It worked for my daughter after she gave birth to my grandson. She was able to lower her bill significantly.;jk8vjha;qztza;4f2ycuv7
“But I love my PCP!”So does everyone else apparently… the biggest determination for a PCP should be availability. If anything is wrong with you they’re going to direct you to a specialist anyways.;jk9jimm;1iyasal4;55wu4o7w
>If she can’t get into her PCP within 3 months it’s time to find a new one.I live in a very populated area and there's been a cascading effect of practices closing to go to concierge instead and it's made finding a new primary EXTREMELY difficult. One doctor decides to do MDVIP closes their practice. Their hundreds/thousands of patients now need to get new doctors because they can't pay an additional $3000 a year for the privilege to continue seeing their doctor so they go to other primaries in the area. Those offices are now being overloaded. Doctors get annoyed at how many people they are now seeing and also close to go MDVIP and now the remaining offices that haven't closed are totally burdened. I've switched primary care docs 4 times in the last six years because they keep closing. It takes me 2 months to get an appointment ANYWHERE now.;jk9sezw;bylk7;55wu4o7w
Yeah in certain places it just doesn't work this way. I live in a major city but we're severely short on most doctors. It takes me 3 weeks to get an appointment with any provider in my primary care facility. I'm lucky I even got accepted they don't take new patients anymore. Depending on what insurance you have there are very few options. Urgent care centers send you to the ER for everything greater than antibiotics for a cold and the wait times are horrendous. Specialty appointments (like the hemotologist everyone is saying she should see) are months out emergency or not. Many people drive 6 hours to a different state because that's faster. It's kind of a hellscape.;jk8wx8e;j6aef;55wu4o7w
It wouldn't matter hgb 3.5 still would send her to ER for a transfusion.;jka6dqz;s5yjhaj8;55wu4o7w
"But why the recommendation to see a hematologist if the problem is excessive menstrual bleeding? Might she need a D&C? Or could she have fibroids? Seems like the root cause has not been addressed yet. Glad to hear she has insurance through parents and a PCP. Any chance they have an HSA that could at least pay part of the bills for you two? More importantly are you sure that you owe the bills; that insurance has already paid their portion? Could be a bit tricky trying to keep track when it's her parents' insurance.";jk8nyfq;6g8a4faw;a10bhy3n
Why a hematologist? She should be seeing a gynecologist asap to address the root cause! This amount of menstrual bleeding is not normal and is likely due to fibroids. She needs an ultrasound to diagnose that and surgery to fix it.;jk8v3mf;793y4a0o;a10bhy3n
daaaaaaaamn. She see the hematologist yet? Or is the appointment coming up?Where are you guys located?;jk8nktj;47kuj;a10bhy3n
As for the discharge home the first time it's acceptable to discharge if normal vitals and hgb improved after transfusion. There isn't a magic immediate fix for heavy menstrual bleeding and usually those pts don't need hospitalization so discharging her was within the standard of care. i personally would prefer a level of 7 with an extra unit of blood but 3.5 to 6.6 is at least 3 units and should have helped her symptoms.  Either way i wouldn't bother fighting that aspect of needing a second visit.  If she has chronic  heavy bleeding this should have been addressed a long time ago with birth control pills iron infusions or hematological workup in an outpatient way rather than waiting until levels got critically low. Seeing a PCP wouldn't have made a difference at this point because blood levels were already too low and they would have sent you to the ER anyways.  Has this never been an issue until now? If she was on iron pills was she getting regular hemoglobin checks? To answer the actual financial question you need to get familiar with her insurance policy and check the deductible and the coverage after deductinle is met. It's possible bills are large because you hadn't met deductible and that the rest and future visits will be all covered. If truly unable to pay whatever is outstanding talk to financial people at the ER. There is financial assistance available and payment plans available.;jka812z;s5yjhaj8;a10bhy3n
Can you be specific in what you have found when you say its super padded?;jk9oh50;4f2ycuv7;c5pv9js2
What were the improper incorrect charges she found?;jk8wvh2;4f2ycuv7;qztza
This happened in my area where a bunch of dentists retired and now everyone is overwhelmed and booking 5 months out.;jkbukoj;3fzp9ak5;bylk7
This. If you live in a rural area there are very limited offerings unless you're willing to drive 1-2hours for a PCP. That said OP might be in a situation where that's the best option. ER visits are just way too expensive.;jka0szz;my2d8;j6aef
Change your mindset. You weren’t lucky to get in you were one of the last ones to get into an overcrowded practice. You want a practice with availability. For a PCP it doesn’t matter how good they are they just send you to a specialist for whatever is wrong with you.It’s better to go to a doctor that had to go to med school in the Caribbean that can get you in today take your bloodwork and steer you to the doctor you actually need to see.;jk9k8gl;1iyasal4;j6aef
That’s really unfortunate your city is going through that. I live in Minneapolis and we don’t have a shortage of doctors/availability as far as I’m aware (again I know that has a lot to do what insurance you have and your access to transportation). We do have a high standard of living so maybe we’re more attractive to doctors. I don’t know the nuances of that.;jkazt4u;55wu4o7w;j6aef
In this instance you’re correct. But it’s more of a broader issue if you’re unable to see your PCP within 3 months;jkalmny;55wu4o7w;s5yjhaj8
I’m not sure why they recommend her to a hematologist as I wasn’t able to be there with her for the appointment. Her PCP also put her on a strict diet and has set up a appointment for an oncologist as she has some symptoms that they said some cancers will produce. As for the bill it shows that they paid for a portion of the cost and it shows how much we owe.;jk8wkvr;a10bhy3n;6g8a4faw
Due to type one diabetes she has damaged nerves and that makes exams hard to do as she has extreme amounts of pain and gynecologist don’t want to sedate her for an exam. They ended putting on a birth control to stop the bleeding and said that will work.;jk8xpbe;a10bhy3n;793y4a0o
Being charged for hygiene products when you brought your own or for equipment you didn’t use like a spirometer. Hospitals charge for a lot of unnecessary stuff.;jk9t29u;c5pv9js2;4f2ycuv7
Many. I don’t have her bill but it was reduced from $15K to $9700. I had this conversation with her again this weekend. It was amazing on how much she had to pay for her birth. One thing that stood out was charging her and my grandson the cost of the room for each of them separately even though they shared the room and were never placed in any other room. There’s more examples but I can’t recall it all.Edit: words;jk8xz3t;qztza;4f2ycuv7

Hey OP. I don't have too much advice but my mom had some bleedings like this and she got a hysterectomy which solved her issue. Obviously this might not be case and there are definitely side effects to this as I'm not a medical professional. Just wanted to share what solved my mom's issue as it seems they are fairly kinda similar. I wish you all the best.;jk9k2w7;7sr4yywx;a10bhy3n
In my experience with my family with multiple ER visits and hospital stays at more than one facility those items are part of stocking the room and are built in to the room hospital or facility fee.  You get charged for them being there whether they are used or not and you will not get a individual breakdown on your bill.;jk9v1sr;4f2ycuv7;c5pv9js2
I'm actually kind of surprised it worked with maternity care since it's almost always billed globally which is basically a lump sum based on the procedure code. Nursery charges are also typically billed out even if you keep the child with you since they need to keep the space available if you change your mind (a lot of people run into this).Was she uninsured? I can see things working a lot differently if that's the case.;jk900ah;2gx31ood;qztza
Are you sure that the bill was not reduced through a combination of the insurance negotiated rate and then your daughter calling and talking to the hospital saying that she had trouble paying the amount owed?  The hospital could of offered financial aid or even a discount if she paid her bill at that time.  I have trouble seeing a hospital making multiple mistakes in their billing yes medical bills seem high but that does not mean they full of errors.;jk925b4;4f2ycuv7;qztza
I agree it’s surprising. It was a weird circumstance where she was covered under my insurance(she’s under 26) but my grandson was covered under my son-in-laws insurance which did not cover as much because the change of event had not happened. It was very unusual which is why this stood out.;jk90ib7;qztza;2gx31ood
I this is my first time having a mortgage. I am comparing mortgage rates between a local bank that keeps mortgages in house  and a local broker who will sell the mortgage to a big time national lender. The local bank is offering 6.5%The broker is offering 5.99% They are both 30yr - Fixed loansIs there any reason I should not take the lower rate?;13id8au;crbskd9v;
Not in my experience.  There might be hassle dealing w/ the next lenders but (assuming $400k mortgage on a $500k home) is that potential hassle worth an extra $47751 in interest over the next 30 yeas or an increased payment of $132/month?($2396 vs $2528 payment in this example);jk96g74;wahf4qvr;crbskd9v
Just because you originate at a local bank doesn’t mean they actually service the loan. Most of them do not. Are you absolutely sure the bank will service the loan long term? Most may start to service it but then sell it off to free up the credit line. It’s rare to have a small bank keep a portfolio loan for something that fits conforming guidelines.;jk9dl09;wmhnv;crbskd9v
Depends on closing costs. Is the lender making you buy down points to get below 6% If closing fees are basically the same take the lower rate.;jk99pbx;c5ed;crbskd9v
There's no binding guarantee the local bank won't change their mind in a year and sell your loan anyway.;jk9wwgh;bcxk0;crbskd9v
No one keeps mortgages in house. They don't have the money to.. the bank would be illiquid in no time. Ask what they mean by that... It's probably the servicing they keep in house not the mortgage. And they may not even have a choice in that I'm not sure how they could assure they could keep that one it's securitized.;jkapaje;10wmyq;crbskd9v
I like being able to go in and discuss a problem with an actual human I decided to go to a local bank who keeps their mortgages in house.  I have never regretted it.  My friend's mortgage has been sold multiple times the last time to a company called Mr. Cooper.  Holy cow the trouble she had.  She ended up coming to my bank to refinance and her interest rate did go up a little bit but she says that the lower stress and peace of mind is worth it.  If you make an extra payment or 2 a year it won't matter anyway.  I would strongly encourage you to go somewhere that won't sell your mortgage but that is just my 2 cents.;jka3vyd;1fw6rdp2;crbskd9v
I think you have a misconception between selling the mortgage as a mortgage backed security which any loan underwritten by Fannie Mae/Freddie mac will be and servicing the loan which is either done in house or outsourced to a servicing provider.;jkaifir;7lewfy0y8;crbskd9v
Nope. They have to honor the terms of the mortgage so you want to get the lower rate. Every mortgage I've had has been sold (three original two refis) and it's never been an issue.;jka3vbq;69ewd44;crbskd9v
Local banks aren't keeping the mortgage in-house. Almost no one does. They might continue to service the mortgage but they're almost always going to be selling the actual debt to someone else.;jkai80a;dag0n;crbskd9v
My mortgage servicer is AWFUL. They've literally never paid my taxes or insurance on time and I've needed to make the payments for 3 straight years but have now gotten escrow waived.  That said I'll take an hour or 2 a year screwing around with escrow analyses / waiting 3-4 weeks for my money back over spending an additional hundreds of dollars out of pocket on even a modest interest increase. I understand this might be cripplingly inconvenient to someone who was paycheck to paycheck but I'm lucky that it's just a temporary dip in the e-fund.;jk9bab6;hiuo6;crbskd9v
We’ve always used a broker it’s been sold then to a large servicer or regional bank … irony at a rate far less than they would give us.Updating your online banking with a new account number for $60k savings? Yes that’s not too bad;jkb0j04;jbkxkr9;crbskd9v
We have had both and prefer the local lender. My first mortgage was sold 5 times the first year we had it. When we bought our second house we used a local lender that was very competitive. The difference is the local never sells plus they offered personal service you will never find in the big guys. They called us twice over the years and offered refinancing when it was advantageous to us. Once when the wife mistakenly miss a payment they called to make sure everything was ok and did we want to do just a interest payment. Never charged a late fee either. We just paid off mortgage on our second home since dealing with them and would highly recommend local lenders.;jka294b;vfj5y;crbskd9v
I think you are confusing 2 separate thingsThere is the servicing of the loan - this is who you interact with each month to make your payments and deal with customer service etc. This can get sold sometimes but not always (closer to 50/50). Larger banks/credit unions will typically keep the servicing since their websites and customer service centers are well-suited to accept payments. Smaller banks/credit unions are more likely to sell the servicing.Then there is the underlying loan. This almost always gets sold to an investor because banks rarely have enough cash on hand to hold the loan to maturity. However if the servicer stays the same then it has no effect on you whatsoever that the underlying loan gets sold so it would seem weird for you to care about this.Which of the two (or both) are you referring to?;jkanfeu;8049s;crbskd9v
Get the cheaper rate. Your loan being given to a bigger servicer is inevitable. Your rates and term stay the same. You just write the check to someone else.Dealing directly with a bank is harder than the broker. The broker will help you get the loan. The bank not so much.The ink on my loan wasnt even dry yet and it was immediately sold to Caliber Home Loans. They were okay. Now it is called New Rez and they are so effing stupid.;jkasom7;pwmlxad9;crbskd9v
Ask the loan agent at each bank where the underwriters are located and how familiar they are with your local market. Underwriters have leeway to ask for specific things that could make getting the loan difficult (uncommon but possible.) Local banks will have more familiarity with the ways loans are done in your local area. Big banks may be more hassle to deal with during the loan process but can often offer lower rates. If you’re willing to put in the time to chase them down and make sure they are doing what they are supposed to on-time a big bank should be ok. Ask your realtor if they know a good loan agent. A good loan agent who communicates well and stays on top of the process is a bigger factor than a local vs big national bank. I’m not sure I understand the comments about which bank services the loan. Unless you feel very passionate about the web user interface of a particular bank for making payments it doesn’t matter which bank services your loan. It can be a small hassle to change the auto payments setup when your loan servicing changes to another bank but you can’t control when or if that will happen.;jkaxyxu;15ktarqw;crbskd9v
There's no reason to go with the higher rate unless the closing costs are astronomical.;jkb16cz;mbfop;crbskd9v
id def shop around and get quotes from all your local credit unions they were all much cheaper than all the banks i got quotes from.;jkacwfk;vfbz4nrk;crbskd9v
I wouldn’t worry about local vs big bank.My mortgage is a local bank who prides themselves on being the best for local mortgages. They sold my mortgage to Wells Fargo by the time the second payment was due.;jkapys4;5qzmjsa9;crbskd9v
Even if they service them now it's not protection that will be true for the life of your loan. In my book the lowest cost is the best choice. You never know who you'll end up with either way.;jkb2aoj;osohq;crbskd9v
I would be shocked if your local bank won't also sell your mortgage but I have been wrong before;jkb6do4;ls1sm;crbskd9v
What are the closing costs?Ask them both to go lower!;jkbn6bb;56bx7uzb;crbskd9v
I had a friend who took the higher rate because the bank was like family to him... I did not have words to convey how much I did not see any bank as anything but a semi predatory leach of my money. To each their own I guess but I have gone with the lower rate every time we have refinanced. (Canada here no 30 year fixed rate mortgages);jkbo2wv;jdhqj;crbskd9v
It doesn’t matter who long term services the loan. It does matter who can actually help get your deal accepted and cross the finish line. Example say you’re in a super competitive market and the 6.5% lender can close in 21 days but the 5.99% needs 45 days. Could make the higher rate worth it because it doesn’t matter how low the rate is if you never get an accepted offer. (This obviously is only if you’re still putting in offers not if you’re already under contract).  Some lenders are also better at difficult scenarios like self employed borrowers etc. and others may stumble and not be able to close your deal. But if you’re under contract already and your scenario is cut and dry take the 5.99% of you think they’ll get closed in time.;jkbz490;nraem;crbskd9v
What’s the refinance process like at your bank? If they are able/willing to refinance easily as interest rates come down in the coming years it could be worth it but that’s the only reason I can think of.;jk9xsju;nqtvahfm;crbskd9v
The American system for this is crazy.Here in the UK you deal with the bank you took the agreement out with. If they want to sell the loan they can but they have to manage the customer for as long as they are a customer.On the flip side the American default of fixed rates for the life of the mortgage is cool.;jkaba58;8qnq4w2;crbskd9v
Are you buying a home or refinancing? The biggest benefit to a local lender is their relationship with local title companies. This is key when closing on a property where deadlines matter. The other is the local lender is more likely to use in house servicing. You can ask the lender even if they have an in house servicing department it doesn't give you a guarantee that they will continue that portion of their business & could always sell it off.    The other thing is to compare all the closing costs between the two lenders. Did the national bank add points to make their taste more favorable? You really need to compare apples to apples.    Having said all that if it's truly a half point spread between local and national providers I would probably take the national. On a $400k home that first year interest will be an additional $2k in interest.;jk9zu86;h779u;crbskd9v
Check fees and points.  But also get a few other direct quotes from a variety of sized banks because the two data points you have are comparing apples and oranges.Brokers don't care who services your loan and may send you to a crappy servicer.  Local banks may or may not have higher rates and may or may not sell it.  Unless you have more data points know lender fees/ points and truly shop the rate you won't know what the best deal is.;jka3evn;eyeolvx;crbskd9v
"Rate doesn’t mean SHIT without closing costs included.My new mortgage: (410k house 185k loan)30 year note 6.25% $1036 to close. They hold the note until maturity.The three I shopped around:30 year note 5.5% 6.5 and 6.75%; $4500 $2800 and $3500 to close. 2 of the 3 were wholesalers.";jkaauhr;fs2ey;crbskd9v
Every loan from a big bank or a small bank has always been sold to another bank.  Do not make your decision for a lender based on this.;jkampni;4b1iez;crbskd9v
What’s the APY on each one? That factors in the cost so you can conparw;jkantl5;a5rko2mh;crbskd9v
It doesn’t matter if they get sold - once you set up automatic payments you’ll never notice the difference Especially since your likely going to refinance it in less than 5 yearsMost small banks or community banks are likely going to sell the loans so they can recycle the capital .;jkaqri4;j005m;crbskd9v
I started with Citibank as they were the lowest rate they sold it and the transition was seamless;jkaricn;13tymd;crbskd9v
"The bank is not really the issue. The mortgage servicer is the entity you will deal with. Most of them like to keep any mortgage they get. Look up ""mortgage servicing right"" if you want to learn more.";jkb87qw;ti6n2;crbskd9v
Take the broker's offer to the local bank and ask them to beat/match it. They almost certainly will. Best of both worlds.;jkb9cx6;5dipq;crbskd9v
Unless you are going to need some kind of forbearance or something I found that pretty much all mortgage servicing is exactly the same. I would just go with the cheapest price.;jkbahgr;3bk8oer9;crbskd9v
Just remember - a lender that claims they will hold and service the loan means NOTHING about what they’ll do with it in the future.Banks decide to sell off servicing for many different reasons.;jkbfn3j;9l4hd;crbskd9v
Take the lower mortgage rate. There’s no guarantee any bank won’t sell your loan. So you might as well take the best deal you can find.;jkbgq72;aah7g;crbskd9v
Take a look at ur origination charges on your loan estimate. That is probably what the broker is selling you on. Most brokers do this. Bet you the closing costs are higher for the 5.99 rate;jkbhib3;7iq56evo;crbskd9v
Take the lower rate but as others have said make sure you look at all the costs (origination fees processing fees etc.).   If you like the local bank you can always give them a chance to match your other rate - often they will.;jkbice9;jgegl;crbskd9v
What are the points for each one?;jkc6mwt;5haff4ix;crbskd9v
They are all regulated and will probably sell them to a new servicer over the life of your mortgage.   Take the lower rate but be sure to compare all the terms and fees to make sure they are equivalent;jkcsvae;a2ra03xs;crbskd9v
broker is almost certainly quoting with points to get under 6.also local banks still sell mortgages off to the big banks in many cases. They may just preserve the admin side.;jkczrp1;nac05;crbskd9v
Sometimes a lender will charge extra closing costs for a lower rate. It’s called “points.” Usually points cost 1% of the home cost. For example one lender can quote you a 6% rate for a 500000 dollar loan as 0$ cost to you. But another lender can quote you at 5% but you have to pay 5000 extra in closing costs for that specific rate. - is the other lender charging you any “points” for the lower rate?;jkd3ets;2bb7vcr7;crbskd9v
No. They will all sell it eventually despite what they say.;jkd88e5;p7q3be3i;crbskd9v
I just bought another house. I was in the same boat first rate I got handed was 7.125% super high! I called another lender got 6.25% my first lender matched it. So I gave the second guy another shot and he got be a 5.125% rate. It is on you to save as much money as you can. When they compete for your money go with what ever one is the cheapest. If all things are the same start asking for fees to be waived. Make them battle for your business.;jkdbwdl;9mo1to5l;crbskd9v
Definitely take the lower rate. I did the same. No reason not to save that massive amount of money. Doesnt really matter which bank holds the mortgage;jkdlqf9;a70pksmq;crbskd9v
That’s kind of what I thought.;jk96wnp;crbskd9v;wahf4qvr
The bank will sell the loan off too. The mortgage is going to change hands no matter who you start with.;jkbxlzp;4da8jrf7;wahf4qvr
Most people sell or refine within seven years.;jkanvsg;a5rko2mh;wahf4qvr
When I used a Credit Union for my first mortgage they sold the loan but serviced it in house.;jkavzdn;3q71j;wmhnv
Not even true with big banks and being serviced by a big bank doesn't guarantee good service.Helped our son and DIL buy a house. The BofA bought Countryside but kept things separate in the background.  The fact that it was not BofA proper mentioned up front. After a few years they disposed of the Countryside loans and their loan ended up being serviced by Mr. Cooper. Sometime later Mr. Cooper screwed up and triggered a late payment. Not a missed one or even more than a month late just past the payment grace period. Reported to the credit bureaus and didn't remove it. It might still be there. Our house loan was with BofA. I wanted to change the checking account that the payment came from to a different BofA checking account. Sounds like it should be easy right? You would be mistaken. It took 4 months and close to 30 hours on the phone to get it straight. They were not on the list when it came to choosing a source for a refi.;jkb1ngo;rr11g;wmhnv
I have essentially just heard word of mouth that that service their loans In house. I’m not 100% sure.;jk9jjcg;crbskd9v;wmhnv
This is the correct answer.  OP should not listen to advice from anyone who doesn’t understand that mortgages have fees and points involved.  The more you pay upfront the more it changes your “effective” interest rate.  You also need to keep in mind how long you expect to keep the mortgage when weighing in your upfront costs.  If you will hold it for 30 years you’ll generally more than make up for paying points.  If you plan to refi (or sell) in a few years you might take a higher rate with less fees/points for example.;jkayuc3;ifsi9;c5ed
Unless it's written into the contract which it very rarely would be...;jkbao72;3bk8oer9;bcxk0
Hell the bank I work for even sells our own portfolio loans to a fully owned subsidiary based in Delaware as an accounting trick to save on taxes.;jkb1qk5;uiv25;7lewfy0y8
Same. Two mortgages were sold to out of state banks that I'd never heard of. Their online reviews were absolutely trash. However once direct deposit was set up I never had any issues in the 6 years I had either of them. My current mortgage was sold to Wells Fargo before I even moved in and despite their really rough reputation I've not had any issues. Knock on wood.;jkauziu;9m20q3ft;69ewd44
name names!;jkbtrv8;5njvw;hiuo6
For real I cant imagine having to re lock rates like you guys do.. That is so crazy to me. People are pressed about affordability  here in the USA but I don't think they realize that our neighbors to the north and you guys with the same price issues also don't have the luxury of a 30 year rate lock!!;jkawhqr;u2gyefrt;8qnq4w2
OP this. I tried to optimize who my mortgage was with as I liked the startup I was working with and they had a nice app. They promised me I fit in their demographic of in-house serviced loans. They sold it off immediately. Perfectly happy with the larger company servicing it now.;jkcdm3d;9wqn8;4da8jrf7
So?You pay more interest upfront and it's still a higher payment overall. It's not some trivial thing.;jkb53ot;10otq6;a5rko2mh
I used a local credit union too and they sold my loan before I even signed the final papers in closing;jkcqzfu;orl9iurb;3q71j
If you have a loan estimate from the local lender look on page 3. Under “Other Considerations” there is a section regarding if they will service the loan or transfer servicing.;jk9noa9;7d9xc;crbskd9v
You may also find they sell your loan but keep the servicing rights.;jka3adv;52cse48h;crbskd9v
You can just ask. Places that service their own loans are incredibly willing to tell you so.;jkabv82;2gwzlarn;crbskd9v
That's irrelevant really. Flagstar Bank sold my mortgage to Rocket despite being an employee there *and* the fact that Flagstar buys a lot of mortgages/services their own. Just because an institution services a lot of their mortgages doesn't mean they will yours.In my experience brokers are better.;jkafbrn;mz191;crbskd9v
I went through a local credit union and they sold the loan as soon as I bought the house;jkajg6s;9jelf;crbskd9v
My credit union sold 30 year mortgages but kept 15 year mortgages in house so it can depend on the type of loan.;jkbwoe6;aadnihvo;crbskd9v
The APR includes points but does exclude some closing costs that you can shop for which may be discounted with some lenders.;jkban35;3bk8oer9;ifsi9
I believe I had a Wells Fargo mortgage for a while. Not a single problem whatsoever.;jkaz1lf;69ewd44;9m20q3ft
It is 'Mr. Cooper'.  Originally I had Wells and even they figured it all out fine but these clowns just don't seem to know how to pay bills.  When refinancing I took a loan estimate into pdf software and made up some pretty remarkable rates/costs that they agreed to match for some reason.  Regardless I'm off escrow now and life is easier.;jkcvke9;hiuo6;5njvw
This my credit union sells the mortgages but services it for the duration.;jkan1ng;10iuzzg1;52cse48h
Yeah I got my pre-approval during our current housing search from a lender who keeps the loans in house. Went to make an offer two weeks ago and then realized... It was First Republic 😅;jkbj2ps;k1p5t;52cse48h
OP did not specify if quorting APRs - and only says “rates”.;jkcsgvi;ifsi9;3bk8oer9
Same my the mortgage on my old house was sold to WF. No complaints. Waived late fees the one time I forgot to click confirm on a payment. Refunded when I accidentally double payed by entering in my total amount in the pay additional field. Also made removing PMI extremely easy and simple. Mr. Cooper on the otherhand I'd be surprised their customer service staff could tie their own shoes or live independently.;jkbpgc4;ohv69;69ewd44
True! But he should be comparing APRs....;jkd9jiz;3bk8oer9;ifsi9
Haha I've had Mr. Cooper 2ce and had no issues. Even made them redo my escrow this year because they messed up (based it on last year's insurance premium) and it was fine!;jkbpqjr;69ewd44;ohv69
Lucky. The ones we got didn't understand the basics of removing pmi.  How you're allowed to man the phones of a large mortgage servicer without knowing that I'll never understand.;jkbq0x9;ohv69;69ewd44
Tha definitely sucks. I haven't had to deal with that (one of the refis was to get rid of pmi so never had it with Mr. Cooper).;jkbq6xd;69ewd44;ohv69
My wife and I had a business together that we shut down in October 2022 (it’s still active with the state but for all intents and purposes it no longer exists - no bank accounts subscriptions domain customers etc.). We had a Chase business checking and credit card that she was the primary on. In October I cancelled all of our recurring subscriptions and waited until December to confirm we weren’t receiving any more charges. In late December my wife went in-person to a Chase branch to close both and they were both confirmed closed to her (we have since lost the paperwork). In March she started receiving texts about payments due on a Chase account which were ignored because all of our other accounts were paid up we didn’t even think it could have been the business credit card since we thought it was closed and so dismissed the messages as a phishing. Earlier this month she saw her credit took a massive 100+ point hit and tracked down it was due to a delinquency on the business card. We spoke with Chase and turns out it was never closed and some subscription services charged the card to a grand total of $200. Now $160 of that we disputed since the services were cancelled turned off and hadn’t billed since October. But the remaining $40 was for an annual plan on a service I still use and want to remain active I just forgot to update billing on it to my personal card. I’ve since paid the $40 for the legitimate charge. Chase wasn’t of any help with regards to the credit score issue so I figured I’d ask here if there’s anything we can do to fix this? This card was supposed to be closed… If not how does this affect us? My score is still 760-790 her score was in the same range and is now around 640. We want to buy a house in the next 1-2 years will this substantially affect our ability to get a mortgage/one with a decent rate? Will this prevent us from being able to get a mortgage with less than 20% down?;13iga62;so2bm;
In the future if you get such a text you can login to Chase and check the account! You should have a login with all your accounts with that bank personal and business. Also they should have sent an email saying your statement was ready or just mailed out the statement if you weren't setup with online access.;jk9zp67;xh5f5;so2bm
Was the balance zero when you closed?;jk9yfb5;sinohuz9;so2bm
I mean... this is why credit scores exist. To show that people can pay their bills on time budget properly and don't leave creditors holding the bag.Ultimately it's 100 pts. Life lesson continue making payments on time and move on.;jk9vqsg;kdjf8;so2bm
We never got the statement email or the mailed statement (email on the account was a personal email we still use not the business email we shut down). And when we closed the accounts our logins stopped working - I had to call them in order to dispute the charges find out what the charges were and pay the $40 I mentioned in the post;jka1tfc;so2bm;xh5f5
YesETA: and it remained 0 with no charges for a full billing cycle before we closed;jk9zbxm;so2bm;sinohuz9
I get that but this credit card was supposed to be closed it shouldn’t have accepted any charges at all but it was left open the whole time.;jk9wuzp;so2bm;kdjf8
If that's the case I would try CFPB complaint against Chase and see if you get anywhere.;jka1z1p;xh5f5;so2bm
Recurring charges have already been authorized. You are still responsible for them even after a credit card has been closed.https://www.helpwithmybank.gov/help-topics/credit-cards/payments/preauthorized-payments/preauthorized-closed-account.html;jka18uu;kdjf8;so2bm
Chase sounds like Capitol One which even if the account has been closed for a year if a charge is made to the closed account will reactivate it rather than denying the charge. I forgot about an automatic subscription payment when I closed the account until I got a bill a year later.;jkb4rqb;9azca;so2bm
I’ll check it out. One avenue we’re also trying is to go to the branch that supposedly closed the accounts to get a statement of bank error which can be sent to the credit bureaus and hopefully get the delinquency removed. If that doesn’t work I’ll try out a CFPB complaint thank you!;jka27fh;so2bm;xh5f5
The OP said it was for a business credit card.  Does the CFPB have any juice over that?  I thought business cards did not have the same protections.;jkaytj7;f2tj4z6;xh5f5
Yes but I closed all the accounts. Only one was for a service that I didn’t close that I failed to update the billing info on but 2 things:1. We never received any sort of statement by email or snail mail2. The others that we disputed were for services that were turned off and accounts closed. They were monthly billing subs that didn’t even bill between October (when they were shut down) until March or February when they randomly billed againAlso none of that was communicated to us at the bank when we closed the accounts;jka1mjk;so2bm;kdjf8
Sure try your approach first but see if they can get the bank itself to correct the error.;jka2enx;xh5f5;so2bm
Right but they'll probably forward it on and you might get a call back.;jkb12k4;xh5f5;f2tj4z6
I loaned my dad $30k in 2005 (technically this was my inheritance that he just decided to use when purchasing a house and he called it an investment). Now my brother has taken over the deed/house and I’m trying to figure out how to calculate what it would take to buy me out. I don’t know how to calculate interest over those many years in a fluctuating market. It seems like $30k multiplied by some average market change for the area could be an option (if that seems fair) but I’m not sure how to find those yearly numbers. What would you do in this situation?;13i5206;t6dcx3;
Woof this is a tricky situation.What I would do is take the percentage of 30k from the original purchase price have the house appraised and then that same % of the homes current value seems like it would be the fairest value for a  buyout.Tbh your brother should not have taken over the house without you guys settling this but that ship has sailed;jk83uve;ws0rgdf;t6dcx3
Your dad used it to buy a house? You claim that was the investment for the money. So your gains if any are based on the house.How much did he pay for the house. Lets say it was $300k. That means you now have a 10% interest in the house. $30k is 10% of 300k.Now get a new house apprasial. You own 10% of the appraised value. No interest. Just all capital gains.Simple as that.;jk8qlub;3zhfi;t6dcx3
Terms of the loan should have been worked out in 2005.  If not I think your brother can make a valid argument that the loan was interest free and he only owes you $30K.Regardless this is a family and relationship question not a personal finance question.  There are cases to be made for zero interest any given fixed rate of interest or equal to the appreciation percentage of the home.;jk8ck8s;zeln01h;t6dcx3
"You didn't loan your dad any money. Your dad took money meant for you end of story.If it was in a trust then it was yours. If it was cash given to you and you were a minor technically your dad had a right to it. So he was either a thief in the first case or a weasel in the second.Simple answer? Like others have said AT A MINIMUM find out what $30k was as a percentage of the initial purchase price. Get that percentage of the sale or appraisal price.The anti weasel answer? You need to know the total amount of money put into the purchase (""the investment""). That's the percentage. Worst case your $30k was 100% of the investment. So I would draft and sign a document that says upon the sale of the property you get $30k or the percentage of the sale price - **whichever is greater**. Because their weasel bullshit is going to kick in and the net profits of the sale are going to vanish. For instance the HELOC that you don't know about. Or the repair when they paid cousin Ricky $20k to drywall a closet. Or any other bullshit that they think of.Because it was an ""investment"" and you are a creditor you should get paid first from the profits before other deductions apply.P.S. If your brother got his inheritance because he was an adult **why didn't he use his fucking money to buy the house!?** Answer: weasels";jkaaiep;3oh89;t6dcx3
I “loaned” my parents a $25000 inheritance in 2002. I’m never getting that money back nor do I expect to.;jk8myzz;6qls17o9;t6dcx3
"Not that this is important any more but why would you dad have deliberately (?) told you that he was ""taking money from your inheritance"" to buy a house?   No offense but honestly that seems like a dumb thing to tell someone as in your kids get what you give them on your passing whatever you chose to allocate them at that time.   Prematurely telling someone a certain dollar value and that you've ""taken"" their inheritance for a certain purpose is just inviting questions and problems. Anyway that ship has sailed as the other commenter said.What proportion of your brother's inheritance did your dad ""take"" from him similarly and put in the house?   Basically what are all your shares of ownership of the house from when he bought it?   Did you dad die and leave the house to the two of you?  Or is he still alive and your brother bought the house from him?  On what terms did you dad give the house to your brother?";jk865ud;63gkd;t6dcx3
That's an odd one but what I would do is take the $30k and turn it into a percentage of the purchase price of the home when your dad bought it in 2005. Ex: if the home was $200k the $30k you loaned your dad would be 15% of the home. Then take the current valuation of the home(whether you go by something like the zillow zestimate or most recent appraisal/market value etc.) and use that same % as what your brother should pay to buy you out. That number should be much higher than $30k though so you and your brother can work it out from there to find a fair number for you guys.;jk94u2o;c12dm;t6dcx3
"I would take the property taxes from 05 and compare the estimated appraisal from them to now and get your %. You're probably looking at probably least 2.5 times what you ""put in""";jk83nei;12brwz;t6dcx3
"Is nobody else seeing....  This was not OP's money that he lent to the father.  It was the father's own money (OP's inheritance) that the father elected to use to buy a house instead.     I'm guessing father said to OP ""Don't worry about me using this money that you would have gotten as inheritance.  I need a place to live but you'll get it when I die anyway.  Think of it as an investment.""  Very different thing.   If above is the case it's father's money to do with as he pleases and OP isn't guaranteed any sort of fixed rate of return.";jkafkt1;3p5xwpuo;t6dcx3
Soooooo ok. This is rough.When you say your dad took your inheritance was it already yours OR would it have been yours once he died? If it's the first option and he took it without consent that's theft and you need to sue him. If it's the second then it was never your money to start with. Or option three is that it was your money and you gave it to your dad but you need a written agreement proving it wasn't a gift.Also if you never got anything in writing you don't get interest. You just need to be made whole. I know this sucks but your brother has nothing to do with this. Your DAD took the money. Your DAD purchased the house. Your DAD owes you.;jka4yee;10ftki;t6dcx3
Let's not forget that your INVESTMENT (the house) probably appreciated considerably over 30 years and you own a chunk of that equity as well.  Probably 6 figures.;jkcpqbu;b0viwyp8h;t6dcx3
Thank you I wish that had been the case too. It’s actually more complicated than what I implied. I want the “calculation” to put into a document that we’ll both sign because I’m not getting the money back until some other inheritance is dispersed *when my dad passes.* It’s a freaking mess that my dad started and he won’t even be around to make sure it’s settled. So I’d like everyone to sign something now agreeing on how it’ll be done.;jk84bo4;t6dcx3;ws0rgdf
This seems the most straightforward to me too;jk8qr33;t6dcx3;3zhfi
Well I was a young teenager in 2005 so I think I can forgive that haha. I’m asking about calculating interest because my brother has stated that he’ll owe me the $30k with interest. And yeah we may decide that starts from now instead of 2005 but the calculation should be the same (just insert start year). I need some ideas for what calculation to use and then we’ll put it in a document and sign it so we’re not arguing over it in the future.;jk8dp1c;t6dcx3;zeln01h
Caveat that the 30k should be indexed to inflation.;jkazuqi;t7lvbc6n;3oh89
Sure I get it. Mine wasn’t entirely consensual and they’re onboard with giving it back so I’d like to honor their wishes of honoring my wishes if that makes sense. If things go sour then I’m fine with wiping my hands of it though. I care more about my family than the money but it would be so nice to have expectations agreed on now instead of an argument later.;jk8o8ha;t6dcx3;6qls17o9
Oh it was inheritance from my grandmother but I was a minor at the time. My brother wasn’t a minor so he got his at the time and only my money was put into my dad’s house.;jk86k2a;t6dcx3;63gkd
Thank you!;jk84in5;t6dcx3;12brwz
No this isn’t the case. It was inheritance from my grandmother which my father was supposed to hold onto while I was a minor.;jkb9y8p;t6dcx3;3p5xwpuo
Well I think my mom considered suing him over this at some point. It was inherited money from my grandmother which he was supposed to safeguard or whatever until I came of age. He blew a large sum of it in stocks and then put money (maybe his own plus the $30k remainder of mine) into one house which he renovated and made a profit on (I didn’t get anything) and then he put the $30k into his own house. I’ve still never gotten anything and was surprised that I *might* still get it back… considering he’s filed bankruptcy in the past re-mortgaged multiples times etc. He’s very old now. We decided not to sue a long time ago but yes it was very very shitty. And no nothing is in writing but my dad told my brother about my “investment” and just “believed my brother would do the right thing when the time came.” So I’m trying to get a document while he’s alive now that we all have an understanding on. My brother didn’t do any of that other stuff but he did accept ownership knowing that my money was in it.;jkbcmuc;t6dcx3;10ftki
Same process. 30k was X percentage in 2005 so PandamoniumRex is entitled to X percentage when dad's estate is distributed or house is sold whichever comes first.;jk9afe6;9yqhq;t6dcx3
Okay! Good info. So I’d say in some ways that makes this easier and in some ways it makes it harder. You should definitely make sure your dad is involved in this the easiest way to deal with it if it’s not an immediate resolution would be to consider having him reflect it in his will that way it’s on paper as you said. ETA: Maybe that’s as simple as you getting the lions share of the rest of the inheritance since your brother already got the house;jk84pew;ws0rgdf;t6dcx3
It's really not.... and it's not a good way to do it. If you provided almost the entire downpayment you probably deserve more of the house than your dad does. Was your dad specific in whether your 30k was an investment in debt or in the property? You could easily argue you were the one that invested in the property based on your dad's comments.;jk9htcj;3shf3;t6dcx3
$30000 times (1 + n)^y where n is the interest rate and y is the number of years.  So if you wanted 5% calculated to now (18 years) that’s $30000 x 1.05^18 = $72198.;jk8e8ti;zeln01h;t6dcx3
Yeah that's approximately 46.7k depending on which online calculator you use.  OP that's your starting point.;jkbnddg;11c3du;t7lvbc6n
Your dad sounds sneaky and untrustworthy-whatever you do have an atty review!;jk86pv6;ski5z6mw;t6dcx3
Ah. Fair enough then.;jkbraaw;3p5xwpuo;t6dcx3
Amazing.  He ripped you off and is going to use your brother to make you whole.  I'm sorry your dad is like this.;jkbnlah;11c3du;t6dcx3
Your best option at this point is to get a lawyer Reddit can only do so much.Your brother isn't the one who stole from you so it's not his responsibility to give anything back. Your best bet is to get proper legal advice. If you're not going to sue you dad I'm not sure there is much you can do.;jkch04k;10ftki;t6dcx3
"Why is not good? It is no different than buying any other asset in anticipation of appreciation.You could have bought some stock with that $30k. Or BitCoin. Or trading cards.How would he be entitled to a larger share than what he bought? If anything his dad could argue that he gets less because he didn't pay his share of the property taxes insurance and other ownership costs of the holding this investment since purchased. You could consider the fact that he didnt' have to continue to sink money into it as his ""interest or dividend payment"".";jk9ud0i;3zhfi;3shf3
Yes that’s definitely the case. Honestly I’d written this money off a long time ago so I was pleasantly surprised that he brought it up when my brother took over the house.;jk8715o;t6dcx3;ski5z6mw
Because he took all the risk by providing the entire down payment. I could show a bunch of different ideas here but I'm on phone and don't really have the time. Let me just say that I do hard money lending where I provide people what amounts to down payments. I would never provide the entire down payment for someone and get only my share of the ownership of the property as calculated from original purchase price. I would be putting up a majority of the risk trusting the other person to make monthly payments and keep the house repaired and be in a very unsafe position. His dad / brother take almost none of the risk. They put zero down and pay what amounts to rent with some maintenance added in. If they lose the house they could mentally write it off since they didn't put any of the down payment. If not they take the vast majority of the gains for what would have been the same cost to rent somewhere else. If op charged his dad a mere 5% interest rate he should have 2.6x his invested amount after 20 years. If he charged his dad something more reasonable for hard money lending like 8% he should have 4.6x his original amount. Op could have easily bought the house himself with the down payment charged his dad rent and have 100% of the appreciation on the property and all the equity. In business if you put in all the up-front costs you are entitled to way more than people who put in the carrying costs which were likely comparable costs to if he had to rent somewhere anyway. The way I would structure this deal if it was offered to me today I would either be taking half the house for putting up the entire down payment or I would be charging a yearly rate of interest on the loan. The way I see it op is owed $90k at least or half the current value of the house.Edit: I should say half the equity. Not half the current value.;jk9xyaq;3shf3;3zhfi
"Also what do you mean by ""took over the house""?   It would help if you were exact about the meaning here.  Does your brother own the house now or does your father?  How did this ""taking over"" happen?  Did  money change hands?Basically is the house still your father's to declare what happens to it when he dies?  If so then he should write into his will that you are to be given x% of it and are entitled to the fair market value of that share of it on his passing to be administered or divided by the executor.   And the x% is based on what your $30k was to the original purchase price of the house.  If the house is no longer your father's because he signed it over to your brother then he needs to strongly make his intention known to your brother that your brother should pay you the current x% share of the value of the house to have it free and clear.  If he cannot do that while he's alive I doubt it will be clearer once he's gone.";jk88b3h;63gkd;t6dcx3
You make a fair point but you're over complicating a family situation. It wasn't a true investment just some dumb situation a father put his son in but it actually worked out for the most part.Just needs to be a simple equation so everyone can walk away happy.;jk9zv2j;e13m5;3shf3
We don’t know how much of the down payment was covered by the loan. But you make some good points regarding the risk to his capital. Perhaps it should be split down the middle. Since the son had no say in where it was invested then they have an agreement for either  the X percent equity or a 5% annual ROI whichever is greater. Basically guarantee of a minimum ROI.;jka1bew;3zhfi;3shf3
I think it was deeded to my brother and that it’s all in his name now. I just talked to my dad today explaining that my brother understood that some form of interest would be involved which was a shock to my dad who evidently didn’t consider that the $30k he took from me (as an “investment” in his house) would… I don’t know… actually increase in value… as investments sometimes do.;jkbb0ug;t6dcx3;63gkd
"My mom tried to do something similar to this once. Said she has an investment opportunity she needed $x and i said oh well tell me about it and she told me how undervalued the property was etc etc. And I said sounds great so what do I get? She said 5% a year interest.  I told her I only do hard money lending for higher percentages with strong collateral or a share of equity... and then she obviously switched from ""this is an investment opportunity' to 'this is a favor'. And when I suggested we go 50/50 because I was putting up all the money and she was just gonna rent it out and manage it anyway she said no. She said why would I give you 50%? I said um because you don't have the money to act on this deal. You get 50% while putting up 0% of the money. But she didn't like it. I said well if I'm analyzing this deal as an investment it's not the type I like really. You have no skin in the game so I can't know for sure you will make sure it succeeds. Family loves to straddle the line between investment and favor. They call it an investment to lure you in but call it a favor when they obviously get all the gain with none of the risk.";jkb8pn9;3shf3;3zhfi
TLDR- Can I adjust my W4 to pull more taxes at my W2 job to compensate for money made as a 1099? I have a full-time W2 job and also just recently began working as a part-time real estate agent. Can I adjust my W4 at my full-time job to withhold more from my checks to help offset some of my 1099 income a little? I don’t even know if it works that way. This is my first year doing this and my first 1099 job so I’m trying to become more knowledgeable in personal finance. I didn’t grow up with the best examples lol TIA!;13i5qul;4i9uc6tp;
Yes you can do this. It's pretty common for people to do this to not have to deal with quarterly tax payments. You can use section 4 to add extra withholding.;jk86n09;32xx1jb;4i9uc6tp
"assuming your 1099 income is somewhat variable i wouldn't recommend doing this. unless you keep monkeying with your w-4 if it goes up or down you'll be withholding too little or too much extra. also worth mentioning that depending on how much your 1099 income is relative to salary you may not be making enough to require making extra payments (you need to talk to an accountant to make sure though). if you meet ""safe harbor"" guidelines there would be no penalty for just paying whatever's due when you file.that said making estimated tax payments is incredibly easy online and you only need to do it 4 times a year. and it doesn't complicate your taxes when you file estimated payments get reported on the same line as withholding.";jk8miud;33s2s7zw;4i9uc6tp
"Yes you can do this it is a fairly common thing to do.  It may be difficult to predict how much to withhold if your 1099 job is unpredictable.  The one good thing about withholding at your W2 job is that no matter when the withholding actually occurs it is considered to have happened evenly throughout the year.  So if you decide you need to you can make up for any shortfall by having a bunch withheld later in the year.  This can help avoid penalties since you are supposed to pay quarterly.  Just be sure you keep a running estimate of how much tax you'll owe for the year.  Of course you can't withhold more than you actually earn (minus things like FICA/Medicare/SS taxes) so there are limits to how much you can do with W2 withholding.You should also familiarize yourself with the ""safe harbor"" rules for avoiding the under-withholding penalties.  If you satisfy those rules (which don't require you to know how much you'll owe this year) at least you won't have any penalties even if you under-withhold.Be sure to look into the rules and procedures for your state as well if it has income tax.  If it does it may have similar but slightly different rules.";jk8kumf;g90hp;4i9uc6tp
Instead of withholding on your w4 you can submit payments quarterly directly to the IRS/State based on your 1099 actuals.;jk8vty3;j6mey;4i9uc6tp
You can but I'm not sure you want to. There is no penalty or interest so long as your withholding is at least equal to 90% of what you owed last year (or 100% of the current year obviously).So if you have the self-discipline to not spend it you could throw that money in some manner of low risk interest bearing until April and get a modest discount on the tax.BTW: when you ballpark the amount to set aside:1. Don't forget to add 7.5% for the self employment tax.2. Use your marginal rate not your effective rate.;jk8lo1x;g68qq;4i9uc6tp
Yes you can do that.  I wouldn’t though.  Real estate commissions are highly variable and unknown.  Will be very hard to get anywhere close to right through W2 withholdings.  Easier and way more accurate to just pay the estimated quarterly taxes based on what you actually make.  It’s a 1040-ES.  Not difficult one pager.;jk89b46;zeln01h;4i9uc6tp
Great! Thank you for responding. I’m sure it was a silly question but I wasn’t sure if taxes worked like that Have a good day!;jk86vyn;4i9uc6tp;32xx1jb
I’ve just never had to send payments quarterly so I’m not sure how it works. On the due dates do I just send an estimate of the taxes based on the income I have received? Or do I send an estimate based on how much I anticipate making all year?;jk9igfl;4i9uc6tp;33s2s7zw
Any tips for putting the anticipated money for taxes into an interest bearing account? I really am so new to all things finance investment etc.;jk9ji9a;4i9uc6tp;g68qq
Thanks a ton! I wasn’t planning for it to completely cover the taxes owed just to contribute to them a bit consistently to lessen the amount due.;jk9k5ep;4i9uc6tp;zeln01h
you don't really have to pay quarterly. The fine is negligible if you just wait until tax time to make your payments. On 60k in owed taxes the penalty was about 1k. You make more than that just putting those into a CD. Also make sure you setup a solo 401k so that you can shield up to 66k from taxes (assuming you make enough to qualify to put away 66k). I should add that paying the taxes using a credit card I got back a ton of points which offset the penalty somewhat even after paying the cc fees. I think the fee was like 1.9% or something and I got back like 2.65%;jkb6euc;12tdywgd;4i9uc6tp
quarter by quarter by necessity. the understanding is that business income is variable throughout the year often even seasonal. so if you make 20000 from 1/1-3/31 pay what you think you'll owe on that by 4/15. if you don't make anything the rest of the year don't pay anything. i do it online at eftps.gov and it's super easy. but if you want to print and mail it's literally just a payment voucher you write your ssn and tax year on and mail it with your check.;jkb8tsc;33s2s7zw;4i9uc6tp
You can find a bunch of banks offering CDs and savings accounts offering 4-5% over at bankrate. There may be better banks or better lists.Also remember next year that 80% threshold will be calculated on this year's taxes so at some point you'll want to start making deposits. Real estate commissions are irregular enough that this is probably a better route than over withholding at your day job.;jk9m9u7;g68qq;4i9uc6tp
respectfully i think recommending incurring penalties purely out of laziness is bad advice.;jkb8x93;33s2s7zw;12tdywgd
This was very insightful I’ll look into it more. Thanks!;jkb9j5l;4i9uc6tp;12tdywgd
Umm... I guess you missed the part where you can put 60k in a CD and make more money than the penalty. I would argue not trying to make the most out of your money is being lazy.;jkba5f9;12tdywgd;33s2s7zw
i'm not going to argue with you. some people use their business income to live off of you know.;jkbfake;33s2s7zw;12tdywgd
I guess I am not following your logic... Take the 60k. You can a) pay it to IRS each quarter (15k) or b) buy a CD with it. When it is tax time you either paid 60k on time or you have to pay 60k + penalty. By investing the money in CD you made more than the penalty so explain to me why does it make more sense to pay the quarterly taxes because I fail to see your logic.;jkbk67u;12tdywgd;33s2s7zw
As the tittle says wife and I were starting to look into buying a house. I paid my car last month and today Credit Karma shows my score gone from 740 to 675. My BoA FICO still shows at 760 but has not updated for May. Is it a bad idea to look for a credit mortgage right now? Should I get for it to bounce back and if so how much time can I expect for it to recover?;13ina7z;9lw4b;
The Credit Karma score is irrelevant.Your important scores are your FICO 5 4 and 2 scores. You can obtain these scores from MYFICO.  The middle of the three scores is what the mortgage entity uses in your application.;jkao4e1;577uwtsi;9lw4b
Vantage scores drop when you close an account FICO doesnt. FICO is what banks would use to assess your eligibility and terms for a mortgage. Dont take Credit Karma too seriously.;jkaug7v;54d01sls;9lw4b
CK can be useful for reports.  Definitely not for scores.;jkb7q0y;577uwtsi;9lw4b
Every time I pay off a loan or note they do this. And if you cancel a credit card fully paid off they do it. Crazy.;jkb1e3h;ev9os;9lw4b
Hey when I paid off my car my credit score dropped over 50 points but literally not even 3 months later everything was higher (and nothing changed besides that);jkbhxg4;6pku8cil;9lw4b
If your score is in the 600's you probably have some other problem.  Older delinquency or a high utilization account somewhere?  Figuring out what that is (by checking the actual report and not just the score) will determine how long you have to wait.;jkchl9a;3quyq;9lw4b
Don't worry about your credit score. Continue paying down all outstanding debt asap before applying for a mortgage loan. This will allow you to obtain a favorable mortgage rate from your lender in the future and frees up more cash for your monthly budget. Hunker down and stack cash. No one is really buying right now. Keep an eye on foreclosures as this economy worsens. You may find deals.;jkbcpen;c5r47fck;9lw4b
we have credit karma can’t remember how we got it is it some subscription we’re paying for without knowing?  If it’s useless I definitely want to cancel;jkawyue;3fie7tb0;9lw4b
It amazes me how brainwashed some people are about credit - no offense to you OP because the companies market themselves aggressively and often;jkbjloc;vira4sxh;9lw4b
Agreed with checking FICO scores instead of Credit Karma.Additionally make sure you’re not using your credit cards for 3-6 months prior to qualifying for a mortgage that the utilization on each is under 30% and continue paying over the minimum each month. Paying them off (and continue to not use them) 3-6 months before prequalifying would be ideal. Regarding the car loan pay extra towards the principal each month if possible that will knock down the length of your loan. The most common advice is to pay half the payment every two weeks and in a year you’ll have paid 13 months off instead of 12 (the math is more complicated than that but you get the gist of it).Your debt to income ratio matters *A LOT* as does your payment history. The banks access how risky it is to give you a mortgage so the more responsible you are with your loans and lines of credit the better.ETA- Saving money will be tricky while paying down debt but saving *at least* 20% for a down payment will put you in a better position when you start prequalifying for a mortgage.I’m not sure how many more fed hikes are forecasted but definitely stay informed as it affects mortgage interest rates.A 15 year mortgage will give you a better rate a higher monthly payment and less of your money goes to interest. That’s advisable if you plan to stay in the home for a long time. 30 year fixed is better if you need lower monthly payments but you’ll pay more in interest over the length of the loan. Check out mortgage amortization tables to get an idea of how your monthly mortgage payments are allocated towards principal and interest.;jkcof9h;cx5wvnjp;9lw4b
And it depends on the lender. If you can provide documentation as to why it dropped they might be able to flex a bit for you. As a former mortgage broker - number 1 rule is to always have documentation to back up whatever you say;jkbmga5;80d78w85;9lw4b
When they run credit or get a FICO score is it based off your last statement amounts? Or is it the current balance.;jkdg59z;9mxj4m78;577uwtsi
Wouldn't MYFICO also go down after seeing the account closed?;jkaoehp;9lw4b;577uwtsi
You're right. Credit Karma is good to see general trends in your credit score but it's a rough estimate at best. It's never matched my FICO score.;jkbimyd;g98el;54d01sls
Only Credit Karma's score - Vantage - does this.The score lenders use - FICO - includes closed accounts.;jkddnxs;t6qw4oky;ev9os
thank you!;jkbpzot;9lw4b;6pku8cil
> Continue paying down all outstanding debt asap before applying for a mortgage loan.My only debt is a 0% - 60 month car. I have enough for the down payment. Right now getting an unfavorable rate is what I am afraid of.;jkbq3k8;9lw4b;c5r47fck
How do you propose OP “pay down outstanding debt ASAP” while also “stacking cash”?;jkbflbr;2in26;c5r47fck
It's a free-to-you service it makes commissions from recommending financial products (and possibly selling data).;jkb9gst;16xx5z;3fie7tb0
I am not sure I understand your point. The better the credit score the better deal on the mortgage rate. How is trying to getter a better rate being brainwashed?;jkbpyxa;9lw4b;vira4sxh
In my experience it depends.  I know my Experian FICO changes immediately upon an event---like an open account becoming closed or making a substantial payment towards a credit card.  In order to really know you would have to look at the report associated with the score.;jkdgl0o;577uwtsi;9mxj4m78
"Not necessarily. The free credit score tool thing from my credit union had me at 780ish with ""no installment loan"" as a weak point but when my lender pulled my actual report the middle score was 804.";jkaopwt;b7caba0n;9lw4b
FICO scores dont distinguish between open and closed accounts as long as it is within 10 years of the account closing.;jkaujwq;54d01sls;9lw4b
MYFICO actually gives about 30 FICOs.  You want to look at the FICO 5 4 and 2 Mortgage scores. Those are the scores that are most relevant to your situation.;jkapmw5;577uwtsi;9lw4b
Definitely not as much as what happened with Credit Karma.It’s worth it to pay the money for MYFICO.  I’m not a salesperson for them.;jkaorie;577uwtsi;9lw4b
No.FICO scores include closed accounts for as long as they are on your report.There can be a small wobble when you close out a loan that usually bounces back in a month or so.;jkddvv2;t6qw4oky;9lw4b
It's not an estimate it's a different scoring model that is used for some things just not for mortgages.The proper way to use Credit Karma imo is to monitor your credit report. If there's a big change in score check the reports to see if there's anything inaccurate like missed payments or a new account you didn't authorize.The number itself isn't very useful. If you want a more useful number get a FICO score from a credit card or something. Be careful though because some use VantageScore (the same as Credit Karma) and some use FICO Score 8. It's still not the one lenders use for mortgages but it's probably more similar and it's used by credit card companies.;jkd0pkv;p9qxi95o;g98el
The best way to get a favorable rate is to get rid of debt especially in this high inflationary economy. The banks are just scrutinizing the hell out of people regardless if you have a high credit score. The banks are fearful since auto defaults are on the rise along with the bank crisis earlier last month.;jkc0vkg;c5r47fck;9lw4b

Pay consumer debt first because:\- Removing interest is a guaranteed ROI\- paying debts frees up monthly cashflow.;jkbjqih;vira4sxh;2in26
It's a simple 2-step plan:1. Pay down outstanding debt ASAP2. Stack cashProfit???;jkbkbh1;9mo24;2in26
That isn't true.    At a certain point your score becomes prime which is the top rate and even then other factors like your DTI play a far more important role.    the most important thing to home lenders is not having negative marks and a strong DTI.;jkcl5x7;vira4sxh;9lw4b
But now that most credit cards and banks offer free credit monitoring much like Credit Karma drop Credit Karma. They exist soley to market you new credit card and loan offers -- most of which are not exactly great deals.;jkdazoz;dudzq;p9qxi95o
They don't offer free credit reports and I like Credit Karma's interface much more than the free annual credit report. I also use the Experian app for my Experian report for the same reason.I have all three major bureaus scores covered through credit cards but I rarely check them because I mostly care about what's on the report itself.;jkdd8ls;p9qxi95o;dudzq
Hi everyone me and my wife are now married! We registered for very little and instead asked for cash. We received about $32k which is amazing but what next? I bought a condo last year so we don't need to save for housing. We combined already have about 60k in savings in various forms. I have 25k in student loans remaining. My wife has about 30k in student loans but her monthly payments are fully covered through through her non-profit's agreement with the State. We plan to spend about 8k for the honeymoon in September and want to keep some of the money we received liquid for fun things here and there. Otherwise we want to boost its growth with consideration to any turmoil in the markets. Advice is appreciated!Edit: we live in a HCOL city in the US and our combined household income is $210k;13iapg4;6q9br;
Love that you guys are going to enjoy the honeymoon. Congrats to you both. I recommend starting with a 6 month emergency fund. Consider paying off your loans if the interest rate is high. If it’s lower than 4-5% just make the minimum payments and put the cash into a HYSA. Also recommend opening up Roth IRAs for you both and funding them fully and investing in index funds.;jk8vy0r;tna8a;6q9br
10K honeymoon 10K emergency fund (this is just a start) and 10K invested in index funds (VTSAX for example).;jk9tt79;71eby0ei;6q9br
Take a percentage of it to have fun and enjoy your new marriage!! Then as long as you’re comfortable with your emergency savings pay off your debt. Then you’ll have one less payment and that amount of free liquid cash flow every month.;jk8v1u4;8tneo9f2;6q9br
Hmmm...if only there was a sort of tool...like maybe a flowchart....where you could just follow it for any windfall of cash.  Whelp we can only dream I suppose!  https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics;jka4jl0;3p5xwpuo;6q9br
I’d throw it in a HYSA until the student debt forgiveness case is decided by SCOTUS. They’ll probably kill the plan at which point I’d pay off your loans. If they don’t pay off 5k and get the rest forgiven. I wouldn’t touch your wife’s loans as long as they’re covered at work.Beyond that it really depends where you’re at with regard to retirement and longer term goals but in general I’d address those things.;jk9ev7z;qqb8s;6q9br
The quickest return on your money is to pay off that debt unless it is really low rate. If it’s above 4% pay it off. Otherwise I’d invest it but that’s me;jka5e56;kdw1m;6q9br
Honestly use 10-12k for your honeymoon - you're only gonna have one (hopefully) so make it even more memorable. Maybe fly first class!Throw the rest at those student loans.;jk8vw0q;47kuj;6q9br
Consider investing in side business such as rental property or airbnbs etc… plan to reduce your student loan and same amount give your wife to treat herself since it is for student loan and it is already covered… bref invest in another condo and rent it as airbnb or long term rentals….;jk9d9ip;bcbkpszlt;6q9br
Honestly at that income level you should be maxing your retirement savings yearly. I see that as a separate issue. You already own a house you already had the wedding and your student loans seem entirely manageable on that income. I say go on the honeymoon have fun and save the rest. Maybe you do decide to pay those student loans off at some stage. Maybe the house needs work. Maybe you decide to have kids.;jka1q77;wass9;6q9br
"Honestly compared to your income 60K is not that much of an emergency fund.  The fact that you have housing already is pretty good but it depends on how much of it is paid off.  My broad suggestion is to enjoy your honeymoon but then figure out a budget and try to save more each month. Your goal s to build up an even bigger emergency fund (which should be in a HYSA) contribute to your 401k/roth IRA and maybe set aside a separate amount to go into a savings account for ""fun stuff"". If you have more leftover you should also invest in something more long term like index funds.";jk949bd;dytqc;6q9br
>_have 25k in student loans remaining. My wife has about 30k in student loans_Pay this shizz off. I recommend using SOFI to refinance at a crazy-low rate (~ 5% APR). or save it for emergencies. We're headed towards a recession.;jk8uc2a;we0h1;6q9br
Just put the money away for now. In a high yield savings account if possible. Never hurts to have savings because life is unpredictable.;jk97rd1;bd668ei5;6q9br
Congratulations!! I think there are too many unknown factors to say for sure what to do with the money but my inclination would be to knock out a good portion (if not all) of your student loan. I’m assuming no other debt or remaining bills from the wedding. Another option to consider especially if you all plan on having a child/children in the next few years is to divert some money to a HSA. Pregnancy birth and care for a newborn can get expensive quickly! The HSA money can always be used for other things if not for this. Again with kids in mind you might even want to drop a couple grand in a 529 plan just for kicks and the added time.;jk99rjs;ei18vc38;6q9br
Typically my response would be to save it all for retirement given your age and time to retirement that kind of money can compound a lot over the next 30 years.But you happen to have enough to pay off that student loan and that's a compound-interest debt.Absolute best thing to do is pay off that student loan take the money you were putting into the loan and double-up on your retirement savings.;jk9fqt6;ckg1d;6q9br
  the minimum you should do is pay off your student loan and any other debts you may have;jkbj9hs;h855piah;6q9br
Look closely at ROTH income limits as your income is around the caps. https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/smart-money/roth-ira-contribution-limitsYou look ok in the short term but raises/promotions may make you ineligible in a few years.;jk9kx2s;qomaz;tna8a
I paid off my high-interest loan my remaining one is under 4% so my monthly payment is so low it doesn't impact my cash flow very much. I was thinking of using my bonus next year to fully pay the rest off. My wife's minimum payment is full covered by her non-profit so she's not obligated to pay anything herself for a few years unless she wants to pay down principal. The HYSA looks appealing to us given the rates and how we plan to use the money.;jkb8o1p;6q9br;tna8a

Of course. But that’s not a given and the timeline is unknowable - except that it would be relatively unlikely to re-emerge in the short term given the political reality in Congress.All the while they would be accruing interest and devoting cash flow to payments. Probably better to just pay off at that point when you’ve got the powder.;jk9m3i0;qqb8s;252ul6w

Today a friend called me asking for advice and I told them that I would get back to them. I could really use all of your help with the wisdom you have. She has $40000 in student debt at 14%. Interest rate through college Ave. Interest has been occurring but payments have been deferred. Soon she will need to pay around 900 to $1000 a month. At the end of the day she simply cannot afford to pay back the debt. She contacted a company called USA-debt-relief-today. They told her to go into delinquency for 18 months and then she begins to immediately pay $300 a month to this company. They apparently offer some sort of guarantee that the college ave company will sell the debt to them. There are other details but I'm wondering if this is the best solution? I don't know anything about bankruptcy but I also know that her and her husband don't have anything and therefore don't have a ton to lose. Any advice or wisdom you have would be much appreciated.Edit: These are private loans through college Ave;13imi50;96zw0;
Don't trust any program that requires you to go into default before they can help you.;jkangsq;o3w9n;96zw0
This sounds like a scam. Most student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. So they are not going to negotiate your friend will be out the $300 will still owe the loans and will have racked up more interest and penalties for not paying the student loans.Bankruptcy is foolish in this situation. That is a tiny amount of debt to declare bankruptcy over. Plus she will still owe it after bankruptcy.Shee needs to get her personal finances in order stop making bad decisions (if she is making any) and start paying back the loans.;jkak4cj;4eq6x3ja;96zw0
The simplest course of action is to budget:1. Write down all expenses2. Write down all incomeThen: 3. Cut expenses to the greatest extent possible4. Increase income to the greatest extent possibleIf Income minus Expenses remains negative after the last step bankruptcy delinquency would seem to be the only option. HOWEVER having student loans discharged through bankruptcy is an uphill battle.;jkak25w;mxfhlhky;96zw0
Whatever she does tell her not to pay this company $300 a month.  They will string her along for years only to tell her they can’t do anything about it. This happened to a co worker of mine;jkauypg;ulkn5ask;96zw0
>At the end of the day she simply cannot afford to pay back the debt.You should advise her to get a second job.;jkan89j;vn3tl1ll;96zw0
If they were government backed loans bankruptcy will not remove the debts. So I'd be very untrusting of anyone who recommended getting behind in any of them. There is a possibility the current company will offer different payment plans. And know that if they are government backed or secured loans they will take your social security checks to pay it also if you haven't paid it off before then.;jkak4l8;z1lq4;96zw0
This is probably a question for r/StudentLoansMaybe they can get IDR - Income Driven Repayment plan where income determines amount due each month.;jkax4o8;s0ef56qe;96zw0
I used to be a paralegal for a bankruptcy attorney student loans cannot be discharged through bankruptcy. Even private student loans. If any attorney or debt consolidation company says they can help her they are lying and they just want her money. Please do NOT default on the loan literally the worst thing you can do for your credit. Do some research and try to refinance the loan(s). I refinanced mine.;jkbo074;m11zn07b;96zw0
Bankruptcy will not clear student loans!1.	⁠Boost credit score2.	⁠Consolidate to lower payment3.	⁠Review spending to find money4.	⁠Increase income to put more towards the debt❤️;jkb8eu8;bdaudvj8q;96zw0
If she has not already done a consolidation that could be an option to get a better rate. There are more resources [here](https://www.studentloanborrowerassistance.org) and [here](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/loans/student-loans/student-loan-debt-help). She should definitely not pay for help especially with those conditions.;jkanzgn;o3w9n;96zw0
Tell her to put her head down and work her ass off and pay of the debt. 900/mo isn’t unreasonable with the money that can be made today;jkb4h5f;ponrsqw3;96zw0
Instead of this scam agency she needs to talk to a genuine lawyer who deals with student loan debt. [https://www.forbes.com/advisor/student-loans/hire-student-loan-lawyer/](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/student-loans/hire-student-loan-lawyer/);jkbje0x;ezrz3p55;96zw0

They could join the military. They have a loan repayment thing where they help protect against predatory loans. I'm not sure it would help in the situation but might be worthwhile to look into. Also education debt relief through the military.;jkbr0r0;atctzjv1;96zw0
She should try to refinance at a lower interest rate possibly utilizing a co-signer if that would help.  While interest rates aren't great she ought to be able to get under 10%.  20 years at 9% interest is $360/month.   Even 11% at 10 years is $551/month. If she can afford $300 she can probably afford $360.  If she can't afford $360 then what did she get her degree in? Does she have a job?;jkbump9;dqa3y;96zw0
Another voice saying do not pay that company.  It sounds like a scam.Please google things like “can student loans be discharged in bankruptcy”.;jkbavby;yjr83;96zw0
How are government backed student loans allowed to be 14% interest that is criminal.40k isn't a lot all things considered. I'd just try to figure out how to not be paying 14% interest.;jkblbe9;mdnrs;96zw0
Since government-backed student loans aren’t generally forgivable in bankruptcy except in cases where the person is severely disabled with no chance of earning income other than meagre disability payments AND there’s no co-signer the probability that this debt relief company is a RIP-OFF is HIGH.If private loans she can stop paying all by herself and doesn’t need a debt relief company to play an intercessory role.  It’s still unlikely they’ll play ball and either way her credit will be ruined.Maybe she should just get a second job.  Or change jobs for higher salary.  Or side hustle.P.S.  I am not a lawyer but in my experience: She probably doesn’t qualify for bankruptcy for $40K a court might agree to reorganization but she’ll have to complete a court-approved financial management course first in almost all jurisdictions.;jkb4t7i;1034zehu;96zw0
Bankruptcy would be the ideal solution here.  However  you can not include student loans so that’s a no go.;jkbrnws;57pxx1sk;96zw0
It is crazy to think that you go broke because you have to pay for the school that suppose to make you money.;jkbqnj0;8fvs4ol3;96zw0
"Your ""friend"" needs to suck it up buttercup because her debt will not be discharged in bankruptcy. She needs to figure out how to pay the $1k/mo until the loan is paid off which with that balance and interest rate would be ~3 years. She needs to figure out how to make extra income for the next 3 years to make it happen. It's completely doable and a MUCH better option than a debt service since those are usually scams.Also I've yet to see a loan company that forces a 3 year repayment term on student loans. So either she's lying or she had a longer term and has waited until the last 3 years to take action. Drop that friend. She's an idiot.";jkclyv6;upp23eek;96zw0
What does she do for a living? The Trump Admin denied everyone that applied for discharge of loan under a social service program. Biden Admin is not denying. The program dismisses the loan if you work a certain number of years in a job that serves at risk populations such as teaching in low income school nurse or doctor in underserved areas etc. Check to see if she qualifies. If not she will need to either cut her expenses to the bone or get a second job.;jkb18ao;mcnu6ija;96zw0
If they are going to default on the loan they might as well declare bankruptcy.  They have nothing to gain from trashing their credit *and* paying part of the debt.A BK attorney will have to look at her loans and see if they can be discharged though discharging student loans is complicated even when private.https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/busting-myths-about-bankruptcy-and-private-student-loans/;jkdeowb;t6qw4oky;96zw0

This is incorrect.  Federal student loans can be discharged in bankruptcy there is just a high bar to qualify for it.And many private loans are indeed dischargeable in a typical BK.https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/busting-myths-about-bankruptcy-and-private-student-loans/;jkdf53r;t6qw4oky;m11zn07b
>  student loans cannot be discharged through bankruptcyI appreciate your experience but this advice is so common that people don't even seek to discharge them. Your employer may be part of the problem. 4 in 10 people are able to have them discharged but less than 1% of people even try.

I’m currently in my 20’s and I’m planning on investing in one of these funds for long term growth in my 401k. Which one of these funds do you think will provide me with the best returns over the next 40 years?;13i6m9t;z482q;
VTTSX is a “set it and forget it” target date fund.  It’s meant as a 100% option with no other funds.FXAIX is an S&P 500 fund.  It’s meant to be diversified with an international fund and a bond fund when you’re older.As to which of these will do better if you (or anyone) could definitely and absolutely answer that question they’d be a billionaire.  There are no crystal balls in real life.;jk8d5aj;zeln01h;z482q
FXAIX has a lower expense ratio and since you are young and will be mostly stocks until closer to retirement I’d chose that over the target date fund.;jk8xgfs;avafuf02p;z482q
The first fund is a target date fund it contains US plus international stocks and some bonds to smooth out volatility. It's a great choice for retirement account.The second fund is just the 500 biggest companies in the United States.It's impossible to know which fund will do better over any amount of time. But the target date fund is a more diversified choice it supports totally hands-off investing you'll never need to think about when to add bonds or how much of your portfolio should be international or how to include smaller US companies.If you're trying to decide between these two do the first one the target date fund with 100% of your 401k.;jk8bfn4;3aif0lno;z482q
They are different tools.  The TDF is completely diversified US and international and glides to more bonds decades from now. The Fidelity product is essentially VOO.  For long-term set-and-forget the TDF is a great choice.;jk8b1mm;lkokq8zl;z482q
Honestly it’s probably not gonna make a big difference until you are ~10 years away from retirement. Both are good options. The most important thing to do at your age is to contribute to retirement funds in diversified funds which both are.Having said that you could buy nothing but the Target Date Fund for the rest of your life and be in a great position. If you buy the SP500 fund eventually you’ll want to add bonds to the mix;jk8kizu;mg6a6;z482q

VTTSX had yielded 8% YoY over the last 10 years.FXAIX has yielded 12% YoY over the last 10 years.You can’t guarantee those returns but for me personally that’s a big enough difference that I do all FXAIX in my 401k.  I do further diversification after I roll my 401k to an IRA when I leave my job.;jk98lgq;73xyb;z482q
The crystal ball is cloudy.You are unlikely to hold only FXAIX an S&P 500 fund for 40 years because at some point you will need to de-risk your portfolio as you approach retirement age.VTTSX is a target date fund with a mix of total US total international and some bonds so is more diversified. And will automatically de-risk as you approach the target date.In other words there are two different strategies here.;jk8b9fy;tecbl;z482q
Why not split the money 50/50?;jk8tq2o;8hem74ow;z482q
The expense ratio difference here is so small it's not worth factoring in. The more important factor is asset allocation. Do you want international stocks and bonds? If so the target date fund is better. Do you just want stocks? Consider something like FSKAX/VTSAX and FTIHX/VTIAX. If you just want US stocks do one of the first pair or FXAIX is fine.Don't buy based on expense ratio alone buy based on desired asset allocation and fund quality (i.e. tracking error vs their index).;jkd842i;p9qxi95o;avafuf02p
I’m also 100% in FXAIX. Love the expense ratio and returns.;jk9qcld;12g170;73xyb
"First time buyers in the united states husband and I have been looking for a year. Turns out we finally found a spot we really like and want to make an offer. We also qualify for a physicians mortgage from his work no PMI and 5.7% with 5% down. All was going well until our mortgage sent over what our mortgage breakdown would look like. Now my husband has been doing some research and finds out we wont really get close to ever paying the house off until year 2050. and even then he says ""why would we pay $2 million for a $900k house?"" Also he says we can put the same ""principal"" amount we'd be paying in savings and it would have more value. He says unless we buy with cash (we don't have that much cash) he isn't sure he wants to do it anymore. Husband also is first generation American so doesn't buy in to US ""need to own everything"" he calls it.  After playing around with various calculators myself it looks like he's right but I don't understand how these numbers could be correct? Why would anyone do this if they're essentially paying double for the home over the life of the mortgage but also only paying such a small amount of the principal over the first 20 years or so? Also we currently are renting at about $3000 for a similar place same neighborhood.

"Remember taxes insurance and HOA fees are not a part of mortgage fixed payments. Only the principal and interest (P+I) are fixed rate (for a fixed rate mortgage). The other 3 can go up immediately (e.g. re-assessed value) or over time. Be sure to reapply for any homeowner exemptions on property tax. They do not carry over from the previous owner.> but I don't understand how these numbers could be correct? Why would anyone do this if they're essentially paying double for the home over the life of the mortgageBecause they're borrowing money over 30 years. If you have a 30 year investment don't you want it to double/triple or more? So does the bank.>only paying such a small amount of the principal over the first 20 years or so? It's just how standard amortization works. The only rule for standard amortization is ""equal payment every month"" while the debt itself always follows I=Prt formula.";jk9bolu;km9r7;bco83oda9
That's a good interest rate right now! With how well-educated/researched you seem to be in your post I am kind of surprised that neither of you realized what that interest adds up to on that big of a loan for that long.  It's really a personal decision between you two whether you want to take out a mortgage or keep saving up for several more years to buy in cash. Can you afford higher monthly payments? If so check into a shorter term loan. Whether you buy in cash or mortgage it real estate is a long-term investment. Over several years the value will just go up.;jk9emb4;torz5uo9;bco83oda9
Everything you said checks out. People take out mortgages and pay more than the value of the house because they want to own it without needing to put down that much cash. This is why mortgages exist. You’re not getting a “bad deal” per se that’s just par for the course with your list price and interest rate. Not sure why you’re shocked at the payoff date - that’s the definition of a 30-year mortgage.;jk9m5y9;1457yg;bco83oda9
You're missing a huge portion of your analysis here. You need to compare the purchase of the house to the amount you would pay in rent and how those values will change over 30 years.There is so much more to it:-what would be the rent on an equivalent house or apartment-what is your assumption for the yearly increase in home value-same for taxes insurance and HOA-what is your assumption for the average return on investments if you invested the money insteadAnd plenty more. Google buying vs renting calculator and you will find plenty that walk you through the process. I have to live in my house for 5 years before it returns more value than renting would have based on my most recent calculations of rent and marketing return. Your numbers will be different based on where you live.;jk9xxj8;zvn3v;bco83oda9
">Why would anyone do this if they're essentially paying double for the home over the life of the mortgage but also only paying such a small amount of the principal over the first 20 years or so? Because they don't have money to buy cash and it's vastly less expensive long term. It's also very strongly recommended to make more than the minimum payment to address this exact amortization issue.>Also we currently are renting at about $3000 for a similar place same neighborhoodAnd what are the chances that twenty years from now your rent will still be $3000?Rent increases by an average 8.85% per year over the long term. In ten years it will break even with the mortgage payment. In twenty it will exceed the **fixed** mortgage payment dramatically.You're also ignoring property appreciation/inflation which averages 4% over the long term. Your $1M home today will cost $2.1M twenty years from now same as your complaint about ""Paying for the house twice"" over the mortgage. Except you're also paying inflating rent in that window.";jk9z0xw;bcxk0;bco83oda9
So it sounds like your husbands mental block is the sheer amount of interest you'll be paying? You solve that problem by paying the mortgage over less than 30 years. Pay it off in 15.;jk9zxt9;d7g0w;bco83oda9
It’s always doctors and lawyers with the worst concert of buying/owning a house. Property taxes and homeowners insurance are not included in your fixed monthly payment. Property taxes increase after a purchase and get re-assed every 1-3 year depending on your county. Homeowners insurance cost increases every year. I don’t think you can afford a property where you can’t put down at least 20%. I’m a realtor and investor. I flip about 10 houses every year and own 12 rentals.;jkaccfb;fs2ey;bco83oda9
Insurance on a 1m house for less than $1000/yr and $2400 /yr in taxes??? 🤯 There’s no way!;jkak9wv;dzm9z;bco83oda9
"As you have realized it's an over simplification to say that renting is ""wasting"" money while buying uses your living expense payments to build equity even though this is how some people think about it at first. The truth of it is that buying also ""wastes"" a ton of money it's just that over the long term factoring everything in (the increasing % of your payment going to equity over time increases in rent prices over time will probably outpace increases in property tax/insurance tax deductions for mortgage interest/property tax every year no capital gains tax on appreciation for primary residence vs paying tax on gains from other investments that could have used that same money etc) you waste a lot less when buying most of the time.  That being said the price to rent a similar space being only 56% of the PITI to own is pretty steep.  You might never come out ahead buying with those kinds of margins unless rent + home prices continue to inflate at such rapid rates in the future (which seems unsustainable but you never know). For reference the cost to rent a similar house to the one I just bought is $2400 while my PITI is about $2600 so when factoring in upkeep costs and everything I mention above it's definitely more expensive in the short term but even the most pessimistic economic models outside of a long term total housing market crash put me comfortably ahead of renting + investing the difference by year 10.  Seems like you might just be in a bad market to buy.";jk9mrus;cuh9w;bco83oda9
$3000 rent for a $1000000 property is very low compared to where I live (PNW). Around here a $3000 rental home is worth around $600000 so the cost to rent vs buy is different. Are you sure you're comparing apples to apples? I have noticed a shift in comparison between rental prices vs buy costs in our area because of the increase in interest rates. Most rental homes have been presumably financed/re-financed the last couple years for 2-3% rates while buying now it's 5.5-6.5%. This is has led to cost of a financed mortgage to drastically increase while the costs of landlords has remained steady so rent has thus far remained relatively steady.;jk9q2sk;a6u7ewq;bco83oda9
Are you sure that property tax ($200/mo) is based on the value of your home and not land only?;jk9tdvg;getfb;bco83oda9
Let's assume that your rent stays at $3000 for the next 30 years. That's $1080000 in just rent and you do not own that property once the 30 year period ends. If you account for an average 3% of inflation/rent increase the figure will become $1752000 and you still don't own any home.Your husband only thought about the house payment and left out the cost of renting and the equity that you'll accumulate over the 30 year period. Do you even like the rental right now? Does it meet all your needs and wants to consider as a forever home assuming you can rent the same place for as long as you want?;jkalj1z;37gg4rd0;bco83oda9
I don't consider a home especially a residence you plan to live in as an investment. If you live in a desirable area then the property will historically grow in value but doesn't mean your going to make money just sitting on it. Your home is going to need money put into it. Things will break or deteriorate over time. Everything has a average lifespan so you will in time be putting additional funds into the home. The reason you buy instead of rent is because you build equity in the home vs build someone else's equity in their property. After 30years the home will be yours and you can cash out that equity. Renting for 30 years you end up with no ownership at the end of the term but you also don't have to pay for repairs. There isn't a right or wrong answer and it really comes down to how the numbers end up working for you and your husband along with your comfort level. We bought when mortgage rates were low at 4% and refinance to go even lower at 2.25%. Our house in 6 years has gone from 522 to 705K. So for us buying was the right choice because it was cheaper than renting a house. With that being said its a house and things break. Driveway $4.5K AC and Furnace $9.5k Interior work when we bought it was $20K we had a rodent problem and foundation issues forcing us to gut the finished basement which was a long term project over 4 years and set us back $35K a section of siding was crumbling so we got it repaired for $4K just to hold us over a few years. We now have a list of things coming up in the next 5 years including a new roof new siding and new windows. So likely all that growth in property value is going to get put back in the house.;jk9kut0;o5ew8;bco83oda9
Your hazard insurance is laughably low by the way.... Every insurer raised rates 30% or more this past year. I'd be stunned if you have anything approaching realistic / good coverage on that valuation for under 300/mo.;jka45g2;1374sl;bco83oda9
"""but I don't understand how these numbers could be correct? Why would anyone do this if they're essentially paying double for the home over the life of the mortgage""For a 30 year loan 5.3% is the magic number where you pay the same amount of interest as the principal cost of the house. It's always 5.3% if you pay the minimum and take 30 years. At 5.7% it's more interest than the cost of the house. Your solution is to pay it off faster than 30 years";jkaci8f;862nk;bco83oda9
"average rates now and this is how mortgages work. you can always pay extra each month to pay it off faster  &#x200B;the rates are actually lower than average mortgage rates over the last 40 years. they were 15% or so in the 1980's and around 10% for most of the 1990's. my first mortgage was 6.25% around 20 years ago&#x200B;if you think this is bad look at rents. if I was a renter in NYC the last 12 years then the similar apartment that I owned would have increased by 40% over that time";jk9ekib;qj4xf;bco83oda9
> Is this a good deal?On the interest rate it's a worse deal than you would have got 2 years ago and a better deal than you would have got 40 years ago. The good news is it can only become a better deal as you can refinance a mortgage and get a lower rate in the future.>  we currently are renting at about $3000 for a similar placeIf you can rent for $3k and a mortgage is $5300 for the same kind of house and your concern is ROI then it's a dogshit deal. You should keep renting and invest the $2300/month difference plus the average $1000/month you will spend on upkeep on a million dollar property. After 30 years you wouldn't own the home but you would have $4.4 million in investments (assuming a 7% rate of return and also investing the $45k downpayment).;jka6cp5;t3ge72cv;bco83oda9
So this is the cost of borrowing money.  Like someone else said look it from a different perspective.  Don't worry about what the bank is or is not getting.  Just worry about your end trust me the bank will take care of itself. First off you get a house to live in and you own it.  You have a place to live.  That's a big part of what you need shelter.  If you pay off the house by 2050 as OP said then at the end of that time period you fully own the house and whatever it is worth.  It's worth $900k now in 30 years it could be worth $1.5 mil or probably more.  You will have a property that is all yours worth more than what you bought it for.  And possibly more than what you end up paying the bank in interest as well.  Now think about what you will be paying in rent if you don't buy a house.  Let's just say $2k a month.  Depends where you live and rental etc.  (Not to mention the rent can and will go up yearly) .          $2k * 12 months * 30 years.  That's  $720 THOUDAND dollars.  You aren't getting that back it's not invested.  It's just in someone else's pocket.  If it fits in your budget and you like the home buy it.  The alternative will leave you poorer.;jk9n2vi;6urzc;bco83oda9
Also remember you can always refinance later with a lower interest rate. Some of the big lender will offer 950$ flat fees to reduce your interest rate and lower your monthly payment. Building equity thru property is a common way in US. If you rent you are helping others to pay their mortgage. The best way is to live there for awhile rent it out to become a investment home then buy a new property repeat and repeat;jka3yw8;3dvsgdcj;bco83oda9
Have you run the numbers on a shorter term? How does a 15 or 20 year mortgage look?;jkaekpf;te2zh;bco83oda9
Well I'm currently looking for a mortgage for an investment property. I think I'll be lucky if I get around 6%. So I would say that's pretty good;jkanabp;a259wgzm;bco83oda9
The tax and the insurance seemed way too low. Make sure you are doing the correct estimates. Your hubby would be even more shock to see that the total monthly cost is actually way higher than what you think.For this to be palatable y'all need to pay 20% down.;jkaoma0;4p45n;bco83oda9
https://www.cnn.com/business/calculators/rent-vs-buy-calculatorTry running a rent versus buy calculator and seeing how you feel after looking at the numbers.;jkar9ra;y00y9;bco83oda9
Math may be scary but it's also quite easy. An interest rate at 5.7% is a decent rate. As a comparison Dow Jones and S&P 500 both have a 10-year average return of 10% per year. This means you should be making as small payments on your mortgage as possible and putting the rest of it into the market and you'll be 4.3% wealthier for it. Counter point the market grows over long periods of time and there may be years (example 2021 and 2022) where the market suffers and stocks take a hit. Remember in these difficult times you only lose money if you pull it out of the market (or if your companies go bankrupt).;jkarf4s;opo4g;bco83oda9
You can also just buy a cheaper house and save money.   Just because you can afford it doesn't mean you have to buy;jkasw84;16ju1t;bco83oda9
Can you add location? All real estate is local so people can give better feedback. Eg. In some states prop taxes can increase a lot with price while in some states it can be pretty much locked down to purchase price and this had wild implications. You are not paying 2M for 900k house. You are paying the extra amount so that you get access to the money you don't have. If you win a lottery tomorrow you can pay off the loan and not the interest. The real Q to ask yourself is how long do you realistically see yourself living in the said house. Longer the time frame buy is the obvious choice.;jkax691;6mewiywr;bco83oda9
well while you rent you aren't building any equity in the property you are living in and you can have your contract non-renewed so less security.  Is your current $3000/month rental comparable to the $1M house?  What would it cost to rent a comparable house?  You have to consider what the alternative to buying a house is and the alternative is renting.  There are situations where renting and investing is cheaper but unless you can sign really long leases (which is unusual for non-commercial properties) than you will have yearly rent increases no equity less control of the property (unable to renovate) or landscape or ... and you can get non-renewed and have to move every few years which is both an economic and emotional cost.;jkb2trd;100jybt;bco83oda9
What you need to consider is the amount you have paid for the home versus the value of the home. You are looking at how much you will have paid after 30 years ($1.9 mil) and comparing that to the value of the house today ($1M). But that is NOT the fair comparison. The fair comparison is spending $1.9 million to own this house 30 years from now when it is worth....something much more than $1M.Why dont you look at what this house was worth 30 years ago or if it isnt that old whay a comparable house in your area was worth 30 years ago.Just making it up for the example lets say 30 years ago that $1M house cost $200k. So 5x over 30 years. If that repeats you would have spent $1.9 million to own a $5M house.  Does that sound better?Of course thats just the mortgage. Actual ownership over 30 years will cost a lot more. Prop tax insurance maintenance.;jkb48jj;54d01sls;bco83oda9
Look into a 15-year mortgage instead? You'll pay significantly less interest for higher payments.;jkbcstk;10yvfk;bco83oda9
Do you see yourself buying a home cash in the future?;jkbl2cx;fzfpdaeq;bco83oda9
Probably an unpopular opinion but I prefer to buy houses when rates are up.  The price of a home is *generally* inversely related to rates.  As rates go up the price goes down.  And vice versa.  However if/when rates go down you have the ability to refinance (if you can come up with 20% down if you used an FHA).  But you'll never get an opportunity to renegotiate the price.  So don't get hung up on the interest paid over the life of the loan if you know or are planning on not being in that loan more than a few years.;jkc44e8;bdd391aga;bco83oda9
Yeah I was reading this and seeing only $2400 a year for taxes?  I pay more than that on my $180k house.   That has to be wrong;jkba99g;11jimd;km9r7
So are you saying this isn't a smart move on our end? How do people keep saying it's an investment if it's the bank who is making the money?;jk9cnad;bco83oda9;km9r7
It all makes sense until they put the real numbers in front of you on the amortization schedule. I also didn't realize how little went to principal the first 2 decades. We can afford higher payments but we'd prefer not. I keep hearing an it's investment but wouldn't our value have to double to make our loan worth it?;jk9fqz9;bco83oda9;torz5uo9
Shocked at the split between principal and interest. I didn’t realize it was structured differently than say a car payment;jk9p42z;bco83oda9;1457yg
This is the situation I came to second. My real life example is the house I am currently in. We bought the house 9 years ago for $235k. It was a stretch for us at the time but we bit the bullet. Flash forward to today I refinanced about 2 years ago at a 2.65% fixed rate and my mortgage payment is now $1700 (property tax included). My home value is now $650k and you can’t rent anything around the size of my home for under $3k per month.;jkb2is7;mp98w;zvn3v
Yeah I was so confused.  OP (or OPs husband) has a rent free place to live?  That’s the only way that makes sense. When I bought my rent of 4K went to a mortgage of 5k.  The way I saw it I was paying an extra $1k (really 2k with prop tax) to build equity that was definitely worth more than $2k a month.;jkb7yiu;j8c51ugl;zvn3v
This is a good perspective thank you.;jkahna2;bco83oda9;bcxk0
That’s it too. His argument is If we pay in 15 years why not rent and save over the course of the same 15 years but not have it all tied up in a single liability. I tend to agree but want a house;jkahdnm;bco83oda9;d7g0w
Based on OPs understanding of how mortgages work this has to be some random online calculator that OP did not adjust to fit their HCOL locale. This is a hot mess.;jkanylu;l7vp5q21;dzm9z
Yeah tax is going to be a killer for a $1 million dollar home…easily 1k a month on top;jkamm3d;rdwaz;getfb
Fair this was based on an estimate. Taxes and insurance we know will vary but we were concerned more so with the mortgage details.;jkag7pk;bco83oda9;1374sl
Thank you this really sounds like how my husband explained it too. We aren’t severely impacted by renting and this sounds like we could potentially buy with cash in year 15-20 if we save aggressively. All options are on the table at this point.;jkag4ar;bco83oda9;t3ge72cv
We agreed and this was our middle ground due to area of my husbands practice.;jkb0vy7;bco83oda9;16ju1t
Yes;jkdiyry;bco83oda9;fzfpdaeq
"Compare it to renting at the same monthly rate@ $4163/mo you'll pay nearly $1.5mil in rent in your case you'll pay $930k in interest and have a property worth (at least) 1.07mil likely quite a bit moreNow say you live in that house for another 20 years after you pay it off you'd spend another mil on rent in that time. &#x200B;Honestly just make extra payments towards the principal and drastically reduce the total interest you pay over the life of the loan";jka1gn9;61t7q4n3;bco83oda9
I do not believe a personal residence is an investment. Look at it from a different lens. You don't have the money to pay the house in cash so you ask a bank to front the money and you'll pay them back over 30 years with interest. The bank takes on risk here but yes it's an investment for *them*. Interest is the cost of having to borrow. It's as simple as that.;jk9dm7z;rox5kgfu;bco83oda9
Because real estate is worth more as time goes on. It doesn’t always outpace inflation but it could depending on the area. But like someone else said unless you are into real estate investment buying a home should mostly be about having somewhere to live. How much money you could make off the sale in 15 years should not be the driving factor in this decision.;jk9kl38;1457yg;bco83oda9
How is it an investment if you’re not even contributing that much towards the principal during the early years?Let’s say inflation increases the price of the home. For example they might say the price of a home doubles every 15 years. If you buy a million dollar home and pay two million on it after thirty years you seem to think you lost a million dollars. But if the price of the home after that time period doubled twice then it’s actually worth 4 million. So you actually gained two million. During the first years your payments didn’t contribute that much towards the principal but they did lock down the price against inflation. That’s just one of the ways it’s considered an investment.;jka90mf;12zfub;bco83oda9
House will be worth more than 2 mil in 30 years most likely. But I wouldnt view a personal residence as an investment...its your home. Do you want to own a home or are you doing this out of some sense that its a good financial move?;jkb3a9k;54d01sls;bco83oda9
"20 years ago I put down $15000 on an apartment in NYC for $135000. Sold it for $228000 in 2010. bought another one for $290000 and sold it for $507000 last year. bought a house for a little less than yours two years ago and the value around $1 million now&#x200B;my mom bought a house for $250000 almost 20 years ago and it's like $550000 now. same with other family I have. this doesn't work for every town and state but if you buy a in a good market and it's a well run town then even if it's break even for years it will increase over time&#x200B;and we're all zero generation americans who came here as refugees over 40 years ago";jk9eyvb;qj4xf;bco83oda9
A million dollar home is IMO an insane decision for anybody to make. Let alone a first-time purchase.;jka8122;nrmap;bco83oda9
How much do you think rent is going to cost you in 30 years?If you are substantially increasing your cost of living by buying a million dollar house then consider reducing your budget and expectations closer to what you are paying in rent. That 1M house will be worth 2-2.5M in 30 years meanwhile your rent will be significantly more than whatever mortgage you have today.;jkah0fh;9ig4z02ls;bco83oda9
It’s a financial investment compared to renting if your monthly payments would be equal. I would stop thinking of this in terms of how much money you’ll make on the house when you sell and if that makes the loan “worth it.”;jk9ns1p;1457yg;bco83oda9
"It isn't structured differently than a car payment.  They are both what is called a ""self amortizing loan"" where your payment is fixed and the variable portion is the split between interest and principal.  The discrepancy lies in the fact that car loans are over a much shorter term and are much smaller principal cost which makes the split look better on a car loan.";jk9r9gz;i57ug;bco83oda9
I believe car payments are structured the same way.;jk9qvts;1457yg;bco83oda9
Look at a 15 or 10 yr term then if you’re worried about how much interest you’d be paying on a 30 yr loan. Night and day difference. Seems like you’re just a visual person but not doing a good job at putting the actual time line in perspective. With a physician salary and disciplined financial management you could have that house paid off in 15 yrs.Car payments are based on 5-6 yr terms or less typically. 30 yr loans are more than 4 times that.;jka2jhv;b68kc;bco83oda9
They are structured the same. However you pay your car off in 4-6 years instead of the 30 for your house.;jka3cub;55w4x;bco83oda9
Car payments are structured exactly the same. Heavy on interest and light on principal until halfway through the loan and then it swings the other way for the remaining life of the loan. Where do you live in a HCOL area that taxes are only $200 a month?;jkanmsg;l7vp5q21;bco83oda9
>His argument is If we pay in 15 years why not rent and save over the course of the same 15 years but not have it all tied up in a single liability.That's a perfectly reasonable option if you want more flexibility.  If you want to own a house now and have it paid for as quickly as possible the mortgage is the way to go.  The appreciation in value of the home works for you rather than against you once you buy.;jkb6hg3;9cxaf;bco83oda9
Truth def an online estimate. I did not adjust but the number is $5760 per year for our county. Really wanted to examine the mortgage numbers not so much the taxes but it def raises another issue/expense so thank you for pointing it out;jkaruqw;bco83oda9;l7vp5q21
This estimate is grossly low. Like no HCOL area has insurance and taxes that low.;jkansif;l7vp5q21;bco83oda9
You should really be concerned about that tax rate. Sounds like that tax is on land only maybe? Is this a new house? I am not sure where you live but where I live our house is worth approximately $900k and we pay $14k a year in property taxes.;jkappj7;3jz1e8e7;bco83oda9
Keep in mind though that rent is not going to stay at $3000/month for 15-20 years. I am not saying buy the house but you are not going to have a $2300 difference every month to invest 15 years from now.;jkaq8ot;3jz1e8e7;bco83oda9
We pay about 3k in rent now for a similar size place in same zip code. So the interest and the rent are about equal give or take $1000 or so. We aren’t opposed to never buying it’s the mortgage terms as structured over 30 years that deter us. The extra payments are a given. But if it doesn’t drastically improve our payoff I don’t see the value if we do move after let’s say year 15. Am I wrong there?;jkah1iq;bco83oda9;61t7q4n3
So the best move here is simple: become the bank;jk9gbgf;6hy85;rox5kgfu
I get it but double the value of the home seems like alot even over 30 years;jk9irm5;bco83oda9;rox5kgfu
Thank you! This makes sense to me 100%;jkar524;bco83oda9;qj4xf
But they are saying they are physicians (or at least one of them is) and likely in a high cost of living area. It might be the norm or even the low end in their area.;jkaa60q;12zfub;nrmap
Depends on the area. Where I am a 1 million dollar house is like a 1500 sqft 3 bedroom bungalo. Hard to find much cheaper. A 2500 sq ft 4 bedroom 3 bath which seems to be the norm these days would be closer to 1.6 million.;jkb3pl9;54d01sls;nrmap
People keep saying a primary residence isn’t an investment it’s a liability?;jk9pj4j;bco83oda9;1457yg
Fair that makes sense. Would this not be the same if we aggressively saved for 10 years and rented? For example if we saved the amount of estimated interest each year then paid cash would that not be the same as a 10-15 year pay off?;jkagomf;bco83oda9;b68kc
And their rent could double or triple.;jkaxn0u;k9vwjzq9;kys6h
This doesn’t make sense though. Using the number you gave in your comment your monthly tax payment will be $480 on top of your mortgage interest and insurance. $500 a month absolutely matters and taxes/insurance go up every year or two whereas a 30 year fixed rate mortgage payment stays the same (unless you refinance later down the road). You’re just not understanding a lot of the core concepts and hyper focusing on random things that aren’t the bigger issues.;jkas86t;l7vp5q21;bco83oda9
But ideally income will increase drastically during that time;jkb3t78;kpu2gsw;3jz1e8e7
One extra payment a year will reduce your loan by 7 years and save you significant interest over the life of the loan. You can also refinance if/when rates come down to save even more;jkazmqx;1gz8c8zk;bco83oda9
You will be paying a mortgage regardless. If you rent you are just paying someone else's mortgage. Landlords to do not give money to their tenants out of the good of their hearts.;jkb9jtf;1wgurjy7;bco83oda9
There should be amortization charts that let you add extra principal payments to see the impact it can be significant depending how much extra you can pay. That said I don't think you're wrong you've definitely given me a different perspective15 years @ 3k year rent = 540k in that time frame you'll have paid about 640k in interest and 255k in principal. You'll have paid a total of 895k but assuming your house appreciates 100k (in 15 years it should appreciate more) you'll get 355k back when you sell your house for a net of: 895k-355k=-540k. So you'd be breaking even. (Also the 3k rent would increase over 15 years and 100k appreciation over 15 years is very conservative.. though there are extra home expenses too)Also have you put a value on the intangibles? Are you gaining parking a yard? The ability to have pets parties control?;jkakxqw;61t7q4n3;bco83oda9
My rent has increased ~7% per year over the last 3 years.  That's just the CPI... If you stay in the same house/apartment you're in now do you really think it will be $3k a month 30 years from now?  Perhaps more like $6k a month...  30 years is an incredibly long time.  You're also overlooking the time value of money and the likelihood that you're future home in year 30 will be worth more than today.It's also possible that interest rates at some point over the life of the mortgage dip back down to 3-4%.  Then you refinance.  Hell maybe your house has appreciated by then and you already have equity in the house to boot so you also walk away with cash in this refinance.You're looking at a mortgage through a single lens and a pretty simplistic lens at that.;jkbdqdi;13jvep;bco83oda9
This is going to be true of any loan you take over 30 years.Another way is to just look at monthly payments. If you need to pay 2k/mo in rent versus 2k/mo in mortgage...it doesn't really matter if your mortgage has interest right? It's going to pull the same amount out of your budget either way. It's not that big of a factor. The big difference is being responsible for repairs or not. Are you willing to learn handyman skills on YouTube?There is so much freedom and pride in making your house your own. If you rent you're not going to invest in carpets and appliances and other improvements. You can have a much nicer place if you buy. Plus you know your monthly bill rarely changes. My house costed half of what it would be today.;jk9q1p1;t6q15;bco83oda9
You can rent forever. No harm in that.;jk9lqjf;rox5kgfu;bco83oda9
It is a lot. But you need to decide what you’re willing to live with in terms of monthly payment (including taxes HOA etc). If you buy a cheap house and took out a 30 year mortgage sure you would pay double what it’s worth but your monthly payment could be low.;jk9mtq6;1457yg;bco83oda9
You can cut down the amount drastically by overpaying. My wife and I just got a 30-year mortgage last year where we pay $1400 a month. Only $200 goes towards the principal. So instead we’re paying $2000 a month. Now it will be done in 15 years instead of 30. We view our mortgage as a minimum payment. If money gets tight we can always cut back.;jkambmx;7oz8x;bco83oda9
The home wont be worth just 1 million 30 years from now.;jkb3dof;54d01sls;bco83oda9
I mean that’s just how loans work. For something like a home you can also think of the total payments as an inflated value of your home. That’s one reason it’s often advised to not finance a car. You finance a $25000 car and end up paying $30000 for it that’s effectively worth $0 when you’re done with it. Your $1mm house might be worth $2mm in 30 years so you break even in that sense.;jkair2x;77086;bco83oda9
You can pay it off sooner which in term means less interest;jkbb9jj;13tymd;bco83oda9
Here's a thought for the mortgage itself you know what your monthly payment is going to be for the next 30 years. There is no landlord who's going to increase the rent just because they want to squeeze more money out of you. The trade off is that you're going to have to do your own repairs and upgrades. And hopefully if you ever move you're going to make a nice profit for a down payment on a new house. And if your stay there forever you'll have a paid off home in 30 years.A good rule of thumb though is to buy a cheaper house than your max allows and as income allows pay off your home sooner rather than later.Also keep in mind that property tax is not fixed and most cities increase it year over year.;jkb1rfw;9m20q3ft;bco83oda9
"One important thing to keep in mind is that the value of money changes over 30 years. Yes you're paying ""2x the value of the house *today* in *today's dollars*"" but 30 years from now the house will (...probably) be worth significantly more and those dollars you're still paying every month will (...probably) be worth significantly less.P.s. the downvotes on this subreddit piss me off come on guys";jkcmylc;s8r93jgn;bco83oda9
I bought a house in the greater Nashville area October 2019 for $225k. Had it appraised for a refinance April 2023 for $396k. That’s $171k equity in a less than five years so yeah it’s extremely possible if not very likely to happen in less time than that.;jkcz8lc;2ru9jtso;bco83oda9
"This is where the point of this subreddit becomes sort of meaningless at a certain point you get beyond ""what makes good financial sense"" and into ""what I want to do even though it makes poor financial sense"". You can and should do whatever you want but if you're asking what makes good financial sense and there are no homes in the area where you have currently chosen to reside that are affordable for you then the answer is to move somewhere else.It's totally up to you to judge how important ""making good financial sense"" is to you. But the assumption that ""that's how much houses cost near me so that just means I have to do that"" is what gets a lot of people into trouble. Your income not matching the cost of living near you does not suddenly negate how budgeting works. If you can't afford to buy you can't afford to buy.Based on OPs response it sounds like they make $400k+ and so a million dollar home may be ""affordable"" to them. I still personally think it's worth considering a cheaper cost of living area and think that anybody spending that much money on a home is well into ""completely and totally unnecessary"" territory. But again that's where the boundary of this subreddit sort of ends. You should decide how to live your life :)";jkb3ctb;nrmap;12zfub
It’s the norm and not too much house for what we need. It is an HCOL since pandemic but starting to cool so our worry is a severe value drop. It’s comparable to our current rental so we aren’t making much changes to our lifestyle per say as it’s pretty set in stone. For context anything below $8500 in total monthly housing cost keeps us below the 25% rule.;jkafs54;bco83oda9;12zfub
Yes sometimes we choose to live in places that have no affordable homes and if we want to be able to spend a reasonable amount of money on a home we have to choose to live in a different place.Or not it's totally your call to spend that much of your money it's definitely your money. But your personal budget doesn't change depending on where you live or how much houses around you cost. They are a non-factor in making that determination.;jkb7vv7;nrmap;54d01sls
The mortgage is technically a liability like any other loan. Once you start building equity in the house by paying your mortgage its value as an asset grows.;jk9sihn;1457yg;bco83oda9
"It typically is a liability. You have repairs property taxes and various other costs associated that are essentially ""sunk"" while you live there.The price will appreciate over time but that is largely a function of inflation and population/limited land available.But you still have to live somewhere so it's a rent vs buy decision. Do you prefer flexibility in being able to move for your career whenever needed without eating too much in costs or are you willing to plant your roots down? Nobody can really answer this for you.";jk9u30h;b7caba0n;bco83oda9
It's a liability in the sense that it's not a bank you can withdraw money from but it's an investment in the sense that you build equity and eventually eliminate the single biggest expense for 99% of households. You're also locking in 2023 costs with $2023 dollars.When my parents started their mortgage the payment of $1300 was far more expensive than renting. Today their payment is still $1300 and they have a 2400sqft house rather than the 500sqft studio I used to rent for $1400;jk9zrrd;bcxk0;bco83oda9
"Look at it this way. If you have a lump of cash sitting on-hand would you consider buying this property and renting it to someone else?If you posted to /r/portfolios asking if your investment strategy is to buy a single house and bank on that single house's value going up you would be laughed at. A single asset is a really really poor investment. You should treat the money you are putting toward this house as largely lost. You have no ability to control the market and your housing value could tank overnight.Sure long-term you probably won't outright ""lose"" the equity you've built. But the gains are poor the risks are high and it costs a ton of additional cash and time to maintain in the meantime.I love owning my home. It's a worthy tradeoff to me. But it would be unwise to consider it an investment. I am *paying* for a place to live that's really about it.";jka8fe7;nrmap;bco83oda9
Well it's not an investment that's going to cashflow. Generally speaking it's a better use of money than renting because in spite of the interest you are still obtaining ownership of something that has value and can actually increase in value via appreciation. When you rent that money leaves your account and you get no financial gain from it.If the interest from a traditional mortgage is stopping you from buying you could keep renting but how many years will it take to save the money to buy a house with cash? And how much will you have paid in rent during that time?;jkaf8kc;mydnl;bco83oda9
Consider that in 10-15 years the cost of the home might increase 50-100%.My home is just 6 years old and has almost doubled in value over that time.;jkahooa;91mqa;bco83oda9
If you aggressively save a million dollars over 10 yrs and that same house is available for the same price then sure buy it in cash. The chances of that happening are very low though as homes appreciate. Would be wiser to buy in my opinion. You both sound young and likely have evolving goals as you grow the family.;jkajwno;b68kc;bco83oda9
If you rent for 10 years you need to account for the rent increase year over year.;jkb1qsp;1457yg;bco83oda9
My insurance is around 1800 per year and my taxes are over 8k. I don’t live in a million dollar home not even close…. I pay an extra $800 a month on top of my mortgage to escrow. Just to cover those two things that are always increasing. They should absolutely be considered when making a purchase. As for taxes they do vary state by state and county. I’m in a high taxed property region so my numbers are a bit more shocking to most. Here a million dollar home are usually around 17k in taxes… that’s over $1400 per month… IN JUST TAXES. OP really needs to consider taxes and insurance when purchasing because it can dramatically alter the perspective on what’s affordable or not.;jkavlmj;dzm9z;l7vp5q21

"> but starting to cool so our worry is a severe value dropThis is where I was saying in the other thread that a home is not an investment. You're putting money toward a place to live. You should spend as much of your money as you want to on your house but it's really not an investment.It sounds like you're making $400k+ which means you can ""afford"" a million dollar home. But it sounds like the thought of spending that much money on a liability is kind of showing you the point I was making about that much house payment being insane. That your spidey senses are tingling about how much money you're losing in all this is really what I'm getting at.Yes you can afford this home. But unlike your instinct this is not an investment. You can't bank on recouping this money and definitely shouldn't assume you'll earn returns on it.Now that you've reframed it as a liability/purchase does it sound worth it to you?";jkb4cuo;nrmap;bco83oda9
Affordability is related to income and places where homes are a million dollars tend to be places where incomes are higher. Spending a million on a house when you make $400k/yr isnt any crazier than spending $150k on a house when you make $60k a year.Obviously it would be nuts to buy a $1M house if you make $60k a year but that doesnt mean its objectively nuts to buy a $1M house for anyone.Chances are OPs purchase of a million dollar house is a lot more frugal than a lot of peoples purchses of 250k homes.;jkbbpve;54d01sls;nrmap

Exactly plus we can continue to rent our current home for 3k. House just cost that much here and my husband can’t relocate to a spot where they are cheaper.

"Apologise for the formatting as I’m on mobile. Two weeks ago I was on my way home from dropping a friend off after the gym and was rear ended by a drunk driver. Thankfully I’m okay but my 2021 Subaru WRX is totalled. She did her job and saved my life but now I’m in the process of trying to sort out next steps.When I purchased in ‘21 my then husband and I had discussed at length the perks of buying new over trying to buy used. I had never owned a new car in my life (paid cash for all my vehicles and they were typically salvage titles as I grew up in a home with a mechanic and always had a repair shop accessible). Since we carried no other debt than our home note and had good credit we bought new the same day my ‘07 Saab 9-3 gave up the ghost. I got a 2% interest rate and had a monthly payment of 520$.Since then I’ve been navigating life and am in the middle of a separation. What turned from me looking for a new place to live has turned into me looking for a new car as well.I talked with the adjusters and there’s no way for me to recoup the loss of the lower interest rate as part of my claim without pursuing civil litigation (which is a whole separate thing that I don’t want to get into). Right now I just need to figure out how to get back to being mobile. I’m trying to look at this through a “silver lining” perspective - I can reduce the amt of monthly payments and put that cash towards other expenditures but I don’t want to sacrifice on safety. I’d like to purchase another WRX but don’t want to lock myself into a higher payment due to interest.Here are the things I know I have to work with:- 7k left over from the settlement once the old note is paid off;- 700+ credit score; and- 5-8k personal cash I can use as a downpayment on top of settlement $I know nothing about the car buying process and am so overwhelmed. Would it be better to buy used or new? And would it be better to finance through a credit union or the dealer? If I go the credit union route do I need to get pre approval first before I start looking? Will this affect my ability to purchase a home or ding my credit score since I’m opening up a line of credit unexpectedly? Also could/should I finance through a personal loan instead of an auto and get a better interest rate?";13idqxb;10if0ch4;
"Check the prices for a gently used (1-2 years) low mileage WRX. The inventory shortage over the last few years has reduced historical depreciation rates significantly but there is still money to be saved.As far as financing always walk into the dealership with external financing pre-approved. It's not common knowledge but the finance guy in the back office is allowed to present you with whatever rate they think you'll accept and earn a commission on that upcharge. In the business that gap is called the difference between the ""buy rate"" approved by the bank and the ""sell rate"" presented to the customer. In modern times this kickback accounts on average for half the dealership profit on a new car sale.First thing they're going to do is blame the higher than expected rates on the Fed and most people accept it. Skip the games and get your qualified rate directly from a lender. It puts the dealership in a position where they make no money off your external financing so many will pay points towards a lower interest rate so that you finance through them because less commission is better than none.";jk9jvkj;bcxk0;10if0ch4
I would go new IF your income can support it. Used cars are still inflated. Typically credit unions will have better financing but when buying a new car check out the dealership offers. Get the credit Union pre approval before you go to the dealership if you are going that route. You don’t want to open any new lines of credit before a home purchase though. So if you are planning on purchasing a home buy the car after. Renting it won’t matter. I would not lease. Personal loans will not have a better interest rate than auto due to them being unsecured.;jk99idv;bmch4rm;10if0ch4
"I'm sorry.   About the separation and about the accident.  I'm glad you're okay.You're in a lousy position...  you need to move quickly (I presume) to replace the Subaru.  Is there somebody you can borrow a car from for a few weeks?  Or rent for a few weeks?Talk to the credit union about financing options.  Have something in your back pocket before you walk into a ""dealership"" -- whether you buy new or used.  You can then make an intelligent decision during the buy.We bought our last car on the day the governor shut down our state.  It was kinda dumb because we didn't drive much over the next few months but it turns out that with the car market it was a great deal.  The story there is that my daughter rolled her car on her way to school teaching the last week before spring break -- and schools went virtual after spring break.  Yeah she was fine too.  Just shaken up.So we've bought 5 new cars over our marriage plus a handful used (including helping our kids buy used).  Used we've always paid cash.  New we've always financed.  Once through the credit union.  Our first car I don't remember who we financed through.  The last time we bought new I negotiated on line (email) and when we got to the dealership there was a thing when I pulled out my checkbook to pay cash.  Turns out the deal included a manufacturer's financing incentive.  After due diligence we ended up financing the minimum to qualify for the incentive and then paid the loan off in full once the first bill arrived.Anyway you need information.  Spend time on Autotrader and Edmunds and [KBB.com](https://KBB.com) and know what the fair market value is for a used WRX depending on mileage and age.  Are you friendly enough with your STBX that you can go car shopping with him?  If not take a friend.  A male friend/relative is preferrable -- maybe I'm being cynical but I think that having a male to talk it over with makes it less likely to get taken advantage of by a sexist dealership.  That said my daughter's best friend got a great big-girl job and wanted to buy her own car.  So she went with her dad shopping.  She knew all the information and knew what was fair and what wasn't.  Did all the negotiating herself.  Very proud dad.";jk9bi51;4eol4rn;10if0ch4
Typically 3-5 year old vehicles are the most economical. Most of the depreciation occurs during those times. I would try to get a 2020 or older models.;jk9sh48;9iss0iro;10if0ch4
subaru has 2.9% and 3.9% special financing right now on the wrx... make sure to calculate that into your decision when looking at slightly used cars... i do think they have some certified preowned lower aprs as well.;jka81oi;lmryp;10if0ch4

35 yr subaru owner.  Here is what a subaru costs for maintenance and depreciation assuming you're going to drive it into the ground (between 250K and 300K miles):  $0.075 for regular maintenance (oil changes tires blades brakes etc) and $0.075/mile for long term maint.  Depreciation is $0.12/mile.  You can use these numbers to compare that new subaru you're looking at vs the used one.

Inflation with houses in my area is awful. I’ve been house shopping since December and it’s been an ordeal to find something reasonable that isn’t top value for the neighbourhood it’s in.

Thank you so much. And we’re on good terms just couldn’t rectify some aspects of the relationship. We’d make great platonic life partners but that’s not what either of us want at this point. I may take him with me but even when we went shopping for him I was the one negotiating prices (it was fun to see the sexist dealers change their tune when they realised I was the financial person in the relationship).I did have a loaner car set up but we also have family in town for my sibling’s wedding (literally when I say life has been coming a million miles an hour it really has) that are not from the mainland and needed to borrow the extra vehicle. I’ll get it back after they leave to fly home.Really appreciate the link and the talk through. I’ll start looking at some local credit unions so I have a good foothold with negotiations.;jkab1jn;10if0ch4;4eol4rn
This was absolutely not the case in 2020-2021 ESPECIALLY not for a manual transmission WRX. Buying new was likely cheaper than buying used.;jkb2yja;wzu7m;9iss0iro

Then it will be okay! You just don’t want to make an offer then go get a new car! Getting a car loan with a lower payment will actually help you since your debt to income will decrease. You will have more room in the budget and the bank will be able to approve you for more.;jkabup8;bmch4rm;10if0ch4
It was indeed. It was at the point where had I wished to sell it even a month after I bought it I could have made money on the car. At that time buying new was a no brainer.;jkbhxwz;10if0ch4;wzu7m

"Hey everyone looking for some insight here. I currently make 3600 a month. My expenses are;Rent 600 (roommates) 80 for internet 425 debt relief plan 293 personal loan Around 3500 in CC debt (changed jobs and had a layover) I try to put 400 on it a month400 for therapy (after medical coverage) Car insurance 125 Thats around 2325 alone for all those. Food expenses are around 350 a month being really frugal About 80 a month on gas I don't have a long commute and I try to not drive anywhere unless I have to. 150 a month in pet expenses Last few months around 400 a month for medical bills since HSA funds are depleted.That leaves me about 400 is a month without taking into account any car repairs or unplanned house expenses. What are my options here? I live on Connecticut btw";13ivbq9;yze6j;
Paying off debt is better than savings in a lot of ways right now and it sounds like you are paying off debt so thats great.If your CC debt is at 10% interest you are earning a guaranteed 10% return on every dollar you spend paying that debt off.Meanwhile money in a savings account is actually negative value because inflation is higher than the interest rate you're payed by the bank.Paying off debts *is* progress and this is a fine time to be doing it.;jkbvu7z;gvpfc;yze6j
Make sure to run your medical through your HSA to get the tax deduction. Put $400 in pay bill reimburse yourself.;jkbx5ep;kmfyo;yze6j
The best thing to do right now is pay off those debts. Whatever the interest rates are on the loan CC debt and other debts will not be matched by you saving. When you have all that taken care of you can start saving.If your health ability time allows it may be helpful to pick up a bit more work to get out of debt faster.;jkbzuga;2cc3hmys;yze6j
While the advice to pay down debt is solid I wouldn't wait until your debt is paid off to start saving. An emergency fund is critical so that if things happen-- vet bills car repair layoff -- you don't have to put those things on a credit card and wreck your payoff goals even worse.I put $100 a month in an HYSA on Ally.com. if you can't swing that $50 or $25 is a start. Keep contributing monthly and let it grow. Even $50 a month is $600 a year which if you need it is $600 you aren't putting on credit cards.;jkci3gn;dl5up;yze6j
Didnt mention interest on your debt but if its a personal loan and a credit card I image its solid double digits. I wouldny save money id throw everything into that debt. The point of having savings is to avoid double digit interest...if you already have that then focus down the debt first..then save.When in doubt more income.;jkc3lqv;54d01sls;yze6j
I agree with another commenter who said paying the debt down is good (pay the one with the highest interest first).   But maybe don't put all your savings towards that.  It's good to have some cash available for emergencies (because otherwise you would accrue even more debt in those instances);jkckm7f;dytqc;yze6j
Hello Sounds like you are being pretty diligent with paying off debt good on you! I personally would looking into a CC with a debt transfer. That way you could have zero interest and hopefully pay off off in a year.  Read the fine print! See what the fees are and make sure you can pay it off in the time. Where these cards make money is when people don’t pay it off and it fucks them over HARD.Make a plan to once that above debt is paid off. Start putting money into a HYSA high yield savings account. I love ally you can have “buckets” in this account for different purposes. I would make sure to first have enough money to cover you deductibles ( car health insurance ect). Then starting saving for 3-6 months of bare bones expenses.  Look up “The Money Guys financial order of Operations” they have great financial advise.Use your Health savings account like another commenter recommended. At some point I personally would invest the money. You can reimburse yourself at any point and time in the future. These accounts are seen as a triple tax loop. Don’t pay payroll tax don’t pay tax on the growth and pay tax on withdrawal for medical expenses. Once you're 65 your HSA is treated like a traditional IRA if you withdraw money for non-medical expenses. A traditional IRA is a retirement account in which the contributions and gains are tax-free but withdrawals are subject to income tax.How happy are you with your job? At a certain point you can only cut expenses so low you may want to increase your income or get a second part time job.;jkcp1k7;8srki9z4;yze6j
How long do you have left on the debts?You're doing about as much as you can you'll have tons of cash flow as those big payments start to drop off.I get it I spent 2 years digging out of debt It's really hard and it feels like it never ends but it is so so worth it.;jkd4fn0;zj94m;yze6j
There's a limit to how much you can lower expenses but no limit to your income.You need to look for ways to make more money.  Promotion second job gig work door dash uber etc.;jkd6bat;18w2yik2;yze6j
I would say try to put away those 400 towards a minimal emergency fund first. Get at least a month's salary in there.  (should take you about 6 months)Then start paying down some of your debt while still contributing a little towards your emergency savings. Maybe 350 for debt and 50 for savings.  Oh and when and if you have to dip into your savings make sure to build them back up instead of paying debt.    It's gonna be tough for a while but you have to stay strong and it will look better when you've managed to clear your debt.    In the mean time you can try to increase your income or decrease your spending to speed this process along.  Like if your commute is short maybe you don't really need a car. Selling it would be an influx of cash and it will free up at least 230$ of your monthly expenses. It also means you won't have any unplanned repairs to worry about.  Maybe you can walk bike or take a bus to work. It's bound to be cheaper than owning a car.;jkcltvt;dytqc;yze6j
"It feels tight because it is tight but you are managing and have a little wiggle room...so really you are doing OK.    You are spending your ""discretionary"" money on debt repayment therapy and pets.    The debt will hopefully be over eventually but you will build up emergency money instead...so no real change there.  The pets and therapy are your hobbies. Your way to a different lifestyle is earning more money.";jkcqbzm;5r7x3mv7;yze6j
Pick up a 2nd job or work OT if it's an option.  From what you list out there isn't a lot to cut from here.  So that leaves increasing income to add more funds to help pay off the debt.;jkd4zdg;dwj45;yze6j
Try using either the Avalanche or the Snowball method to bring down your debt. There are YouTube videos that have extensive information on these two methods. Prep your own meals and refrain from going out to eat. Pause all investments including IRAs. Just invest enough of your salary to receive your company's matching contribution for your 401 K. Once you have ended your debt your options will open up immediately to save and invest more aggressively for other endeavors.;jkc23n5;c5r47fck;yze6j
The $80 for internet (esp if you have roommates to split it with) and $150 for pet expenses seems high. Does your pet require medications or special food or something? How much are you spending on food/eating out? If you are healthy enough there’s the short-term option to sell plasma (usually can get several hundred in the first month as a new donor) just to build up a savings buffer quicker. I wouldn’t suggest doing that longer than a month or two but it helped me out this year when I got a surprise tax bill.;jkcozar;4il2w4zo;yze6j
It looks like you're doing everything right. Besides your rent your debt relief plan and personal loan payment or your biggest expenses. Besides earning more money you're just going to have to ride out your credit card and loan payments. The $400 a month I would suggest splitting into two payments of 200 that deposit into a savings account automatically for every paycheck. At the end of a year you'll have close to $5000 in savings. Once you no longer have your loan and debt recovery payments you'll be able to increase that amount to $800 a month. You don't have to save big chunks of money at a time for it to count. When you have more in the future you'll save more.;jkctne6;raa5wn5b;yze6j
Look at acorns you can make it small but it builds;jkden90;6yogxcti;yze6j
Never knew that was a thing. I'll definitely be doing that;jkbxc36;yze6j;kmfyo
>While the advice to pay down debt is solid I wouldn't wait until your debt is paid off to start saving. An emergency fund is critical so that if things happenAgree but a 6 month EF is going ot be hard to come by with all that unsecured debt.  If some of it is 24.99% APR forget trying to stack up cash to beat it.This is why people suggest a $1-$2k rainy day fund to take care of something like a blown tire an emergency room visit/prescriptions or some other temporary need.;jkcs3ea;vira4sxh;dl5up
I don’t understand this point of view. Maybe it’s more psychological?  Example. $1000 cc debt. For six months you are putting $100 a month into savings instead of paying off the credit card. After six months you have to fix your car for $600.  In the end all that’s happened is you paid more interest to the cc because you haven’t paid it down. So your cc balance is $1000 + interest chargesOr you could pay $100 a month into the cc for six month. After six months you’re at $400 + interest charges. You have to fix your car for $600. Cc is back up to $1000 + the reduced interest charges since you’ve been paying it down. You come out ahead in this scenario.;jkd0s77;4op0o;dl5up
Love my job now just stated end of January. It's a 50 percent raise from my previous job.;jkcqmy2;yze6j;8srki9z4
I have like 4 years left on the personal loan. It's not for a lot and I can early pay. I just needed the monthly payments to be low. Debt relief is a weird one. Supposed to be at the end of 2024. I've paid off 3 of 5 one left I'm paying structured on. Last one who knows we have no idea who the hell ownes the debt;jkd5jb1;yze6j;zj94m
I pay less in rent to account for the internet (easier then multiple payments) and yeah my pup has a specific diet it didn't use to be that bad with things being more expensive it's crept up. I eat out very rarely and when I do me and my GF will go Dutch makes it easier for both of us.;jkcr1m5;yze6j;4il2w4zo
I’d recommend trying to negotiate out a payment plan that’s less than $400/mo for your medical bills;jkd98j2;4ny7cqib;yze6j
Not sure if you are prescribed any meds but found significant savings myself so I always mention [costplusdrugs.com](https://costplusdrugs.com). Took my monthly med cost down about $50 just on one prescription and was very easy to set up.;jkdo7yz;14ci7c;yze6j
I automatically get 10% of my pay contributed to my pension and my employer contributes 14%. I already have an emergency savings. I have seen general guidelines of 15-20% but I also know most people do not have access to pensions does this change that general rule since my employer contributes so much?;13ihglg;budi4;
Same situation.  You need to estimate how much income you'll need in retirement and how much your pension will pay out each month.  From there you can see how much you'll need from other sources each month and there are calculators/formulas that can tell you how much you need saved by retirement for that amount of income replacement.;jk9tei1;dy5s4jg;budi4
Also pensions occasionally have a way of not coming through.  I'd be doing a little Roth IRA as well.  Pensions are taxable income so you might like some after tax funds available?;jkak9hh;5r7x3mv7;budi4
I think it would be reasonable to count your contribution but not as reasonable to count your employer contribution.  the employer contribution likely is to cover future benefits for you to cover differences between assumptions and actual results necessitating additional payments to cover current retirees and get overall funding levels higher.;jkabdeh;6belb;budi4
A pension should have a formula or something to where you can estimate the benefits when you retire.  Ignore the % you contribute and determine what if anything you need to do to to bring that # to what you want to live onYou might also want to have some money over and above an emergency fund set aside so for larger purchases outside of the monthly pension.;jkbs8u7;8egl6;budi4
**Is that 14% additional or 14% total with your 10%?**What's the \*actual\* dollar amount you are saving? There are a lot of posts on this but many suggest you save more than just the pension. For sure you should try to max the $6500 Roth IRA contribution every year. You need to work backwards from your retirement goals. What matters is how much in total you are saving not the percentage. Compound interest works in your favor even more so when you are young. Take what you expect to earn at the highest point in your earning career. Assume you want to live on that for the rest of your life. Use the 5% draw down rule which is what you can safely withdraw from your retirement without dipping into it. Generally you can draw $50K/year for every $1M saved.  Subtract your pension from your target goal divide by 5% and that's your goal. There are online calculators that will help you figure it out.Here's an example. Let's say you want to live on $100K for the rest of your life. You have 30 years to retire. Your pension will pay out $60K/year. You want to make up the $40K difference. $40K is 5% of $800K. Now you know the number. You want to save an additional $800K on top of your pension before you retire. How much to save every month over 30 years? At 7% return in an S&P500 index fund on average over 30 years if you save an additional $710/mo you will have $805K in the market after 30 years. Do that math for your specific example and that will tell you what you need to save.;jkbyzv0;ckg1d;budi4
Do you know what fund they are investing in? How much rate of returns are you getting?;jka21y0;7stb95m7;budi4
Depends on the pension how strong are it's financials? Those are monster numbers for a pension I would imagine the payout is high.;jkb1nbj;6p1mt;budi4

So my situation is as follows: My father died in 2021 and I started the probate process in 2022. During 2021 I was inbetween jobs and had a few months of forebarance. At the end of the forebarance period I actually had enough cash on hand to bring the loan current and easily resume making payments. But then something happened. I was locked out of my account due to two people being on the title (myself and my father). This happened during the probate process. It took a several months for the probate to actually complete and my father's final tax return helped me out. Even after all of this I still have about enough to bring the loan current ($24000). The problem now is that there is a reinstatement fee on top of all of that. I cannot afford to reinstate the loan. I tried applying to the HAF in my state but apparently I am not eligable. Would my best option be letting the home go into foreclosure? The home is worth over $400K and the amount owed is about $250K. When the bank auctions off a home do they sell it at market value? Or any amount they want?Thank you everyone. I am trying to stay relaxed during this difficult time.;13ijhqu;9i8k4;
Probably worth a few thousand dollars to hire an attorney who specializes in estate law and real estate to ask these questions to over a 400k home.;jkagmdz;ak796;9i8k4
>When the bank auctions off a home do they sell it at market value? Or any amount they want?They sell it for whatever they can get quickly.  They have no real incentive to sell it for more than is owed and return the surplus to you if any.Is there a reason you don't just sell the house yourself?;jkaqff4;vn3tl1ll;9i8k4
So I got behind on some stuff and made a choice and it was to not pay two credit cards. Total is about $9k. They have been closed and sold to collection agency. I get letters and basically can clear both for about $3500 how do I know for sure it will clear the debt and clear it up on my credit report? Credit karma doesn’t even show them as bad debt. My score keeps going up because of a card I had with $25k limit for 15 years that has hardly anything on it and no late payments etc.  my score is about 700 and don’t want to mess that up which may be too late.  Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.;13ijnxh;ngq0o6cu;
You need a letter from the debt collector that says the payment will pay the debt in full. The letter should also specify how the collector will report the debt to the credit reporting agencies.;jka4t5h;1u70ji4g;ngq0o6cu
Also do not pay them from any account that you keep money in.   Find a way to pay them So that they will have no idea of your banking information.   Do this only after they have provided you with written confirmation that what you pay will be full payment of debt;jkbj2ep;h855piah;ngq0o6cu
You need them to agree to a “pay for delete” in writing after X days of paying the $3500;jkb50h0;getfb;1u70ji4g
"TLDR: i have almost $80k saved for the next stage of life (house wedding ring etc) and a seprate efund.  My car loan is about $21k at a 6.99%. No student loan no other debt. Should i go aggressive monthly and pay this down as fast i can and not touch savings and keep investing/saving some?Background:Hello all. I currently live at home (moved to a different state for first job then moved back after second job brought me closer to home).I make about $95k annually base and can make potentially 4-6% more based on sales incentive.I have about $110k invested with most invested in Roth IRA and 401k and i contribute monthly to DCA in a roth IRA to meet the annual limit. I hit contribute 12% post tax  my employer matches some amount My guaranteed base take home after contributions is $2800 (in June i will start paying health insurance sadly). Its hard to predict as our commission plan is trued up after a whole year (big paychecks usually come months after we sold something) but i would say average $4k a month annually.I feel dumb to ask this cause i might know the answer but i have almost $80k saved for the next stage of life (house wedding ring etc) and a seprate efund.My car loan is about $21k at a 6.99%. No student loan no other debt. Should i go aggressive monthly and pay this down as fast i can and not touch savings and keep investing/saving some?Or just knock it out with current cash savings and be done with it I have such high savings cause to me you can never have too much cash on hand for the next stage of life. Im also a pessimist as i know my partner and i will probably buy a hosue together and the weddings will probs be sahred by family; but again its money so lets be safe&#x200B;THanks!";13ih8gc;vqyqevo2;
I'd pay off the car loan. If you were to apply for a home loan lender would look at your monthly expenses/debt etc. Having no ongoing debt looks better to underwriting.And good on you for saving for the ring that could be a large one time expense right there.;jk9smax;8s5sby7r;vqyqevo2
I'd pay off the car with the savings. You're unlikely making 7% on your savings account. By paying it off you're making that 7% back. Congrats on where you're at financially. It's amazing.;jk9t9e1;8serdx1y;vqyqevo2
Can you beat 6.99% interest on the savings when you account for compounding?What is your level of comfort with debt? Personally if it were me I’d leave the savings alone if I could knock out the debt with income in a year or less.;jk9srx1;ic6a1rxw;vqyqevo2
It’s 7% I actually would. I typically don’t say pay the car loan quick but that’s a bit of a high interest rate what I would do is make double payments for a year than 150% For a year and then 100% until completion;jkbft99;5pyfsjix;vqyqevo2
"I don't have an answer to your question so this is off topic but fun to talk about:> I hit contribute 12% post tax my employer matches some amountAre you not doing any pretax contributions?The reason for this is always ""yeah because then I don't have to pay taxes in retirement"" but coming to that conclusion with no other factors means one isn't comparing apples-to-apples.Imagine that the tax rate was 90% and you made $1000. Everything else in the universe is the same.With a regular 401k investing 10% you'd invest $100 because its before tax. Choosing to do roth instead you wouldn't be able to invest 10% because that would be the rest of your money. So you'd choose to do like 10% of your net. So you'd only invest $10.Its easy to see that because you were able to invest more because of the pretax functionality of the regular 401k you'll have a lot more in retirement even if you have to pay tax on that money.Of course in real life the difference is much less exaggerated so its harder to chose the right path. But an interesting thought experiment.";jkbc679;atmtn;vqyqevo2
6.99% isn’t great but $21k owed isn’t terrible especially with your income. You could double pay every other month and knock a lot of interest off with not a large hit to your saving ability;jkbh8td;vff6mbe9;vqyqevo2
Thanks! We’ve had discussions numerous times and we absolutely are ready for that direction. But obviously I haven’t picked out the ring so I don’t know the exact price but I’m assuming $15-20k atleast;jk9syl0;vqyqevo2;8s5sby7r
Thanks! I worked my ass off but my parents set me up for success with very little college debt though my academic scholarships covered a lot.I agree that I won’t beat the interest rate but it’s hard to beat the value of time and saving up all my cash. But I agree with yoh;jk9twez;vqyqevo2;8serdx1y
Can’t beat the interest rate closest I’ve found is like 5% and there’s taxes too if you really want to dive in numbers.I’m comfortable with debt because I had enough to buy in cash. It’s hard to justify buying a car in cash when it’s going to tank but at the same time like why waste money on interest. But I go back and forth lol;jk9t7hy;vqyqevo2;ic6a1rxw
HSA is the way to go. It's completely tax free when you use the money for medical expenses and if you end up needing to use the cash for non-medical expenses in retirement it's like a traditional IRA with no RMD.;jkbjcn9;gvuf0vaw;atmtn
Agreed! For now I am doing post tax cause of the taxes in retirement but also one thought is switch to pre tax once you make more money/have kids house etc cause you can reduce taxable income. I also had a rollover Ira from my first job which was mostly pretax I believe;jkbcxj0;vqyqevo2;atmtn
Before I married my wife i was debt free minus my house. The freedom of zero payments FAR outweighed any interest I could be earning. If you have debt and a pile cash is it really your pile of cash? 🤷‍♂️;jka9hpy;8serdx1y;vqyqevo2
I mean the longer you pay interest on the car the more you pay for it in total.;jkb8lvj;ic6a1rxw;vqyqevo2
I don't recall this ever being an issue in past years. Usually both federal and state take their money pretty quickly. I used Tax Act and according to their site both returns were accepted.

HelloI lost my wallet 2 years back.There were fraudulent transactions on my credit cards. I talked to CC companies and resolved them. Now recently I received a debt collection letter for the amount of 700$ the timing of the transaction matches my wallet losing time. I marked the letter stating it’s not my debt but now they sent a letter stating I now owe 1100$I don’t even know which card the fraudster used .What can I do in this situation;13irayp;8sku2l04;
first things first contact the collection agency to dispute the debt & request a valuation of debt. also be willing to provide any documentation that you have that supports your claims of it not being your debt & that you were a victim of identity theft.;jkbjony;8vfsm863;8sku2l04
I need your opinion please. Mid 40s and have  250k in mortgage 30 years term 3% interest.My dream is to buy a small land for farming and for retirement and to use as a secondary residence and vacations.I have some cash available.- should I pay off my house remaining balance which is 250k.Or - buy the land and have another mortgage but it will be with a balance of only 50 to 70k. The land may or may not appreciate by time and I don’t expect it will generate any revenue for years. But it will generate a huge pleasure for me.What do you think?;13ihcdh;pjf6580g;
Regardless of your decision to buy land or not paying off 3% debt is not a very good option.;jk9s96r;okpso;pjf6580g
Not quite an answer to your question but some people I know who sold a home in a HCOL to buy a nice piece of farmland to raise kids on are now in their 50s and she's saying no way can she retire there. Too much physical labor needed to maintain in old old age even if it isn't an active farm.;jkalvjh;4kyqyf2z;pjf6580g
Unrelated to your question... it always amazes me how someone's retirement dream can be a living nightmare for a different person. I just sold off my grandparents farm that had been in our family for 80 years. I worked my tail off to get an office job so that I would not have to be a farmer.;jkb50te;6m6pc4d9p;pjf6580g
Imagine not having a mortgage. No payments to anyone but your utilities. That sounds awesome.;jk9spej;8serdx1y;pjf6580g
I would invest the money before paying off the house. Whether or not you want to buy the property or invest the money (or do both) is more of a personal choice - what would bring you the most combined happiness?;jk9wgte;1457yg;pjf6580g
That is the point. 3% is an awesome rate. But also this 250k are probably going to be 700k if I keep pay it for another 30 years.;jk9t0yw;pjf6580g;okpso
Thanks for the advice.;jkapy86;pjf6580g;4kyqyf2z
Yeah the easiest time to do the farm is in your 40s or younger. Things get harder the older you get.;jkb6nt7;wp9a7;4kyqyf2z
That is interesting but it is not the first to hear it.Office job is potentially a pay check to pay check fear of layoffs or manager having a bad day. Worry about the rent and your bills. Wake up every single day on someone mowing his backyard.Why did you hate being a farmer?My neighbors see my backyard and my front yard and they are saying “ Man you have been a farmer in a different life”.. sadly I grow up in a large city.;jkb96os;pjf6580g;6m6pc4d9p
He already has the money to pay off the mortgage.  When you have that much sitting in your account it then the thought of making your monthly mortgage payment is no more daunting than your utilities.Whether the money is sitting in the banks account or his own account depends solely on who he'd like to receive the interest.  Right now in his circumstances the money is worth more when he has control of it.;jk9wavg;18w2yik2;8serdx1y
250k will be 2 million if you invest it for 30 years.;jk9uspx;okpso;pjf6580g
At 3% over the next 30 years 250k in principal will incur about 130k in interest costs.  So you pay 250k right now and you avoid that 130k.OrAt a 6% average annual return compounded annually over 30 years an initial investment of 250k with no other contribution will return $1.4 million.;jk9v5bc;18w2yik2;pjf6580g
You have 30 years remaining on your mortgage? That would mean you pay a total of $380000 over the course of the loan. Not $700000.;jk9uohe;1457yg;pjf6580g
It's the large amount of constant physical labor that takes a toll on your body in a cycle of never-ending work. It's a harsh and shorter than necessary life.I see so many viewpoints that want to romanticize farm work. There is nothing romantic about shoveling hog manure for the 785th day in a row of 90 degree weather also knowing that there will be even bigger pile there tomorrow.;jkbnafc;6m6pc4d9p;pjf6580g
So that means no for my both listed options.;jk9veew;pjf6580g;okpso
Good point;jk9vio8;pjf6580g;18w2yik2
You are right but that is still 630k total;jk9v7of;pjf6580g;1457yg
Hehe you are right.;jkcs61y;pjf6580g;6m6pc4d9p
"No I'm not saying ""don't buy farmland because you can invest in stocks"" -- you have to weigh the pros and cons there.I'm saying don't pay down a 3% mortgage when that cash can be better used elsewhere.";jka0tni;okpso;pjf6580g
When did you start paying this mortgage and what are the monthly payments?No you don’t add $250k to $380k. $380k is the sum of the mortgage payments over 30 years if you took out a $250k mortgage at 3%.;jk9w5qk;1457yg;pjf6580g
The key here is how much you think the land will appreciate. It's a math problem.Will you make more off the land?You say above you'd pay 380k more on your current mortgage. So in order for it to be worth it you need to make 380k off the land to break even.There are many more factors yo this though obviously.  You could flip the land in 5 years make a profit then pay off the mortgage. At which point did the money you make off the land cover the additional mortgage cost?You have to do out these calculations to know if it's worth it or not. The reason the guy a above is saying that it's not worth it to pay off is because e typically you can make more than 3% off investments.If you can park the money in an investment and make 4% then it's a better option than paying off the mortgage.;jka0ugt;60ltq;pjf6580g
Good point;jka16aa;pjf6580g;okpso
2 years ago and 2k payment.;jk9wezp;pjf6580g;1457yg
If your payment is $2k you are either including property taxes which are put in escrow or you’re mistaken on the amount/term/interest rate. A $250000 loan at 3% and 30 years should have a monthly payment of $1054;jk9wv60;1457yg;pjf6580g
I’m including taxes;jk9wyk3;pjf6580g;1457yg
Taxes don't go away if you pay off the mortgage.;jk9zxq8;xh5f5;pjf6580g
Okay what is the principal and interest payment? Not including taxes because you have to pay taxes regardless of having a mortgage;jk9xbek;1457yg;pjf6580g
Yep;jka0ls1;pjf6580g;xh5f5
As the title states I bumped into a parked car while parking. No major damage was done and I was able to get in touch with the owner of the F150 I bumped. From what I was able to see the damage was extremely [minimal](https://linksharing.samsungcloud.com/g3p0WyWMC6QK)Ypu might have to zoom in to see it. Nonetheless I was at fault for said damage and gave the owner my insurance and personal information. The owner offered for me to pay for it out of pocket to avoid the headaches of going through insurance. I have never been in this situation as I've never hit anybody so I am unsure of which route to go. He is offering to take it to multiple shops to get some quotes and he will choose the one in the middle. This happened in California. Thank you;13igf98;gq0kdn8x;
You already have done the right things - wait for the quotes and go from there.;jk9nlkz;6jzgsmog;gq0kdn8x
I will tell you you're going to get some sticker shock. Bodywork is outrageous. Good on your for owning up. You have to balance your deductible with the cost of the repair and decide what to do based on that. I agree a release of liability form is a great idea. If they don't want to do that that's a huge red flag and it's insurance time.;jka6wn5;d7g0w;gq0kdn8x
Same thing happened to me.  I backed into a lady in a grocery store parking lot. I didn't want to go through my  insurance since i literally just got my car fixed after hitting a deer. So we exchanged info and the lady got a quote from her mechanic.  She only got one quote so I'm impressed you're guy offered to get multiple that was nice of him.  I wished she would have done the same but i didn't feel comfortable asking her  she seemed really distrustful and on the edge of just calling my insurance company if i made things too difficult. Her quote was for 900 bucks.  At first  I wanted to call in and pay the auto shop after she got the work done but she wasn't comfortable with that and said she didn't have the money to go get it fixed and take the chance that I wouldn't call in to pay.  After thinking about it I understood and came to the conclusion that it's really none of my business what she does with the money. She could decide to pocket it and not fix the car for all I care. So in the end  I drafted a letter saying we both agreed to those terms  that I would pay according to the  quote and she would not hold me liable afterwards. We both signed it and that was it  never heard from her again.;jkayhgi;epvh4ef8;gq0kdn8x
"Whatever you do document document document.  If i'm on the receiving end of not at fault damage I'm almost ALWAYS going to insist on going through insurance because they have a checkbook I have faith in while you are some rando.  Best case you pay all your bills either way; worst case I like my odds with a licensed insurer over some guy.  If i'm on the giving end I'm going to try and avoid the headache of hitting my rates over a few hundred bucks (assuming your car doesn't need repairs too) but the risk here is that the guy you hit comes back for more money later and what are you going to do? If you do agree to cash to close the matter get them to agree even if only over text that this makes everything whole and there's no other damage or liability on your side.";jk9om9b;hiuo6;gq0kdn8x
my guess is $1000. parts are cheap but the labor to sand it down prime and paint will be close to $1000;jk9vu32;qj4xf;gq0kdn8x
I always pay out of pocket to keep my insurance clean.;jkabhg4;1idu8iep;gq0kdn8x
Note that depending on the amount of damage you may have to file the CA DMV report forget which form it is.;jkakz7p;o0364;gq0kdn8x
I think it also depends on your insurance rates and the amount of damage done.For example mine are high as hell. $200/month for a 2017 Honda fitIf I did $1k-2k worth of damage I would most definitely pay the person cash rather than have my rates go up.  If my monthly rate goes up by $50 that’ll be $1200 after two years. But if I had a clean record I’d consider putting anything over $1k through insurance;jkcdcn6;jnzskp91;gq0kdn8x
Is it typically better to not go the insurance route? If I do I plan on getting a release of liability form from somewhere online. Will that actually protect me or should I pay someone or some site for one?;jk9o23e;gq0kdn8x;6jzgsmog
What are they asking you to pay also as a less expensive route have you Thought about just getting a new phone number;jkbg67p;5pyfsjix;6jzgsmog
Thank you for the reply. I feel the same I would typically want to go through insurance however I don't think it would be the best course if the damage is only a couple hundred dollars and it appears that way. My big corners are the ones you mentioned. I would hate to pay them and have them make a claim or ask for more afterwards. Would you suggest downloading a template of sorts from online and having both parties sign them? Once again thanks!;jk9qmot;gq0kdn8x;hiuo6
From my own limited experience with bodywork and seeing my own bill a few years ago I'd say around 3k with all the BS raised prices on everything. My phone could barely blow up the pic but it looks like a door and while doors aren't cheap this one doesn't look like it needs to be completely replaced so no worries about them having to buy a new one.;jkb3s1d;mu55ix44;qj4xf
Depends on your state I would just do some googling;jk9wb1p;6jzgsmog;gq0kdn8x
Some people aren't scumbags and actually want to pay what they owe.;jkbkzxp;pkrhd;5pyfsjix
That would be ideal but if I’m the guy I’m not signing anything until the work is done. I kid you not I’m headed home to run my wife’s car back to the shop because a parking lot swipe repair is fading already. I like to think the shop would do right but having an insurer in my pocket helps.;jk9sao8;hiuo6;gq0kdn8x
Nowadays insurance companies will use any claim as an excuse to raise rates - that *includes* the person on the receiving end of the damage that did nothing wrong. Yes in theory the guy you bumped whom I assume wasn't even in the car or driving at the time could still get his rates increased as well just for filing the claim as that's just the scam world we live in. It's also a reason why many are more willing than ever before to settle things without involving insurance since they do shit like this now all the time.;jkb3f3z;mu55ix44;gq0kdn8x
I hear you. Ideally I would only ask for the signature when I have the cash in hand and we are paying for the finished repairs. Unfortunately I too am dealing with a similar problem. Some guy backed into my wife's car and after repairs it appears that the shop didn't do a good job aligning the panels.... Hopefully they don't give us trouble.;jk9teg3;gq0kdn8x;hiuo6
My partner and I have been living in our first apartment for 2 years now and just renewed our lease for another 8 months because we are planning to move when our lease is up in January. We are moving because we need more space and we have had a few problems with our current apartment. We both spend most of our time in the apartment because we WFH and are homebodies and we would like to move to a bigger apartment in a nicer building with more luxury amenities.Our combined monthly income after taxes is ~$6400 but we both expect to get a raise at some point this year. Both of us got new jobs last fall and I am guaranteed a raise in October (and another one next October) but my partner is unsure when and how much his raise will be. When our increased rent takes effect next month we will be paying $1700/month (it has only been ~$1400 the past 2 years) and my boyfriend has a $450/month student debt payment. I keep track of both of our budgets and in the past few months we have been paying ~$200 on utilities ~$600 on restaurants ~$500 on groceries ~$450 on shopping/entertainment ~$90 on gas/car maintenance and ~$300 on misc. expenses such as doctor’s appointments ($2140 total). We also plan on eating out less when we move so that we can afford a higher rent. We each transfer money to our HYSAs every month depending on how much we have left over and I transfer money to a Roth IRA monthly.I have already started looking at apartments in the area and most places I’ve looked at are over $2000 for a 1-bedroom w/ den or a small 2-bedroom and some are even over $2500 because this is an expensive area in Maryland. However these are spring rent prices and we will be moving in the winter when rent prices should be lower. How do I determine what the maximum we are willing to spend on rent is? I still want to be able to save every month (I hope to buy a house someday if possible) and I am willing to spend more for a nicer apartment but I have no idea how to determine our cap besides what I've seen people say about the 30% rule (although this seems very arbitrary and should probably be adjusted depending on someone's situation). This rule is confusing because I have seen some websites say to use your pre-tax income and others say to use your income after tax. If we both get raises in the fall next year we would be making ~$125K combined pre-tax but I'm not sure about the monthly take-home after taxes and deductions.We will also have to hire movers because we have some large pieces of furniture and we are on the top floor of a building with no elevator. This will definitely eat up some of our savings but hopefully not too much and hopefully we can stay at our next place without moving again for at least a couple of years so we don’t have to pay movers again right away. Any advice about how to keep the cost of moving as low as possible would also be appreciated because we have never hired movers before.;13ifvc6;944a0beu;
"Budget for what you make now not what you think you will make.  I had ""guaranteed"" promotions/raises that fell through 3 years in a row. Don't believe it until you have something strong in writing or better yet when the money is in your account.";jk9mto4;dy5s4jg;944a0beu
My husband and I take home about $6500 a month as well and our rent just increased to $2175 a month. It’s doable for us and we save about $2000 a month still but we also don’t have any debt or student loan payments to make every month. $2500 is a little steep but it depends what you value most!;jk9q4u0;bvkwtesh;944a0beu
Since you don’t plan to move for a bit start living on a budget like you live in the new place. (I would also ignore the raise for now). Basically add up all the expenses of the new place - included higher rent utilities transportation etc. Now subtract the amount you currently pay now. Whatever the difference is put it in a savings account at the beginning of the money and ignore it.This lets you not only calculate and know what the higher costs will be but actually feel what it’s like to live on that budget. Plus you put some money away for moving/deposits.It’s up to you if you want to choose the $2000 or $2500 place but you have time to try both for a couple of months before deciding.;jkaeqj1;2gwzlarn;944a0beu
"You ""should"" be able to afford that rent. Word of caution though that car budget is awfully small. It seems like you haven't had a big repair or something like that in your months of tracking. Also where is car insurance?Another thought since you both WFH why stay in the expensive area in MD? The rent increases at your new place will likely keep pace with any raises (if not go up faster) so keep that in mind as well.";jka1n4m;iqgya;944a0beu
Since I am on a GS 9-12 track with the federal government I am guaranteed the raise unless I get fired so hopefully that doesn't happen!;jk9n0fh;944a0beu;dy5s4jg
I hope to find us an apartment for cheaper than $2500 in January especially since I have read that you can get good deals in December and January. So an apartment that is around $2500 now may be much more affordable for us by then. And depending on our raises this year we should be making more than $6400/month by January which will also help.;jk9r358;944a0beu;bvkwtesh
That's a good idea thanks!;jkagids;944a0beu;2gwzlarn
My dad is paying for my car insurance and I only get gas about once a month. My car got an oil change and maintenance inspection in January and I am not due for another one yet. We both WFH currently but my office is planning to reopen next summer/fall (it's currently under construction so everyone is fully remote) so I have to stay in the area sadly. But after my office reopens I will only have to go into the office once a week so I will still spend most of my time in my apartment.;jka2v3u;944a0beu;iqgya
"Gotcha I'm a state government employee. We also get yearly ""step increases"" and I've never had those fall through.  My situation was performance/merit raises.  It was a real slap in the face when I would have my annual evaluation receiving nothing but high praise and compliments from my supervisor only for his boss to call off the pay increase 3 years in a row.";jk9o4d5;dy5s4jg;944a0beu
"That makes sense on the WFH situation. With respect to the car oil changes are good to budget but you'll have things go wrong with it at some point especially as it gets older. Brakes need to be replaced new tires when you get a flat or they are worn down engine noises new battery... those things get expensive pretty quick so I'd recommend adding at least $100/mo to a ""car fixing"" item on the budget. That way you don't have as much of a problem when you get dinged for a $1000 repair.";jka3tja;iqgya;944a0beu
I definitely understand why you would be annoyed by that. I believe my partner's raise will be a performance/merit raise because he doesn't work for the government which is why I am not counting on his raise as much as my own.;jk9p0ih;944a0beu;dy5s4jg
"Yeah that is something I've worried about since I got my car 3 years ago because it's a 2010. I'll add that to my budget as a ""just in case"" thing thanks!";jka44kd;944a0beu;iqgya

Life isn't all about the money. You've made some good choices but your life circumstances have changed. It might be time to focus on investing in your own happiness and satisfaction instead of in real estate. Pursuing a new career that will give you the income you seek while increasing your job satisfaction and general happiness sounds like a great idea to me.Just be sure to keep some money in an emergency fund in case your plans don't work out.;jk9phhb;xyw0i;85kkk6syo

I'm 20 years old Male live in Staten Island NY and drive a 2017 Toyota Prius Prime Advanced with about 96000 miles.The car is owned outright and the title and insurance is under my father's name and I'm put down as an additional driver. We have Geico and 3 other cars under the same policy and signed up for 6 month lump payments and were still paying $3731 for it!! I get good student discount blah blah blah.I started driving the car in April of 2022 when I just about first got my license. And I did hit a deer in February but the payment didn't change because I was not at fault. No tickets other than a red light camera.I want advice as to what to do different company different coverage etc. Any help or input is appreciated. And if this isnt the rigjt place to ask lmk. Sorry if formatting is weird. Questions are welcome.;13iecea;4vi6fv5g6;
You're a 20 year old male with basically zero driving history and you already have a claim and a ticket.  I wouldn't expect you to find cheap insurance anywhere.  As a family (since this would include your parents) you can shop around for quotes from other carriers.  You may find a better deal elsewhere.  Or maybe they can bundle it with their homeowner's insurance carrier.;jk9h9ar;dwj45;4vi6fv5g6
"Nothing to do but check with other insurance companies to see if better rates are available. It might be complicated if your family also uses Geico for home insurance - rates can be ""package deals"" when you combine different types of insurance (i.e. so to compare rates your family might need to be quoted for the whole thing together home plus cars).";jk9blzy;6jjfisov;4vi6fv5g6
Young male with a short driving history... Outside of shopping around for a better rate or maybe dropping coverage to liability only there may not be much you can do unfortunately.;jk9cjy7;7gt27mrs;4vi6fv5g6
Car insurance rates jumped this past yr. It sucks. Try and shop around but it likely won’t find any better deals.;jk9n0t8;3yymg;4vi6fv5g6
How much do you drive? You might want to break off of the family plan and get a policy with Metromile or similar which is pay-per-mile insurance. You'll pay a base rate plus a certain number of cents per mile. If you don't drive many miles this could work out well for you.;jk9iu68;i8lyb;4vi6fv5g6
I'm not sure I fully understand your math/breakdown. There's 4 cars on the policy 6 month lump sum. Total 4x cars annual is $7462= \~$155 per month per car.;jk9wd7k;hi8wm;4vi6fv5g6
Get a quote from everyone. Go to an independent insurance agent and get them to get quotes as well. 621 is really high for that car. Even with your history.;jk9tf5e;59vizofj;4vi6fv5g6
Get lots of other quotes. I pay $350 a month for 4 cars and 4 drivers two are under 18. I got some quotes of over $750 a month from some carriers. The difference is enormous so just shop around and go with whomever is cheapest.;jka0z6q;d7g0w;4vi6fv5g6
You might want to try a captive agent in your situation too (State Farm Allstate Farmers  Liberty Mutual). In general brokers are great but captive companies are great at bundle discounts. So if your parents are willing to switch their Home insurance too that can save you a good 25% to 40% on your auto rates. The most expensive part of coverage for a young driver tends to be the collision coverage. See about dropping it or increasing the deductible. You see the biggest drop in price there. Also when you quote ask them if they rate the drivers on the car they drive or the entire household. Some companies will rate you on the car you drive meaning that the other cars on the policy don’t see a price increase. Some companies like Geico will rate all the drivers on all the cars. Which can significantly increase every cars rates instead of just the single car.;jk9xuyy;12f0gd;4vi6fv5g6
Outside of just shopping around try taking a defensive driving course it should lower your rates.;jka1kjp;arp4kxf;4vi6fv5g6
Does your father (or you/any drivers) have questionable credit/driving history/insurance claims record? Having your fathers name as co-owner could impact these things.;jka2318;getfb;4vi6fv5g6

Why do you have a car in NYC?;jkajk7c;i300u;4vi6fv5g6
"Do you have comp/collision or liability only? I would also check about the deer thing; companies change your rates based on if there was a payout not who was at fault. (Although as I type I realize this may vary by state all I can say when I worked in insurance that was very much not the case for my state) - but either way even if the deer is at fault you can’t charge a deer so your company paid for services and may impact your rate. The best thing is to call the customer service (or go online) look at your coverage and see what applies. Many places need to see grades every year to keep the good student discount so you may have lapsed that discount and not realized. There may be good driver discounts etc. Insurance depends a lot on things you can’t change (like where you live) and a lot of things you can - like what mileage you drive what coverage you get.";jk9oc87;vdzmeiaa;4vi6fv5g6
"""the payment didn't change because I was not at fault""that's not how it works. if you have an accident even if it's not your fault your rates go up a substantial amount.evidence: my wife has been rear ended twice completely stopped at a red light/stop sign both times. insurance nearly doubled both times (takes 5 years before it falls off the record).";jk9yg9p;3uro5vep;4vi6fv5g6
Shop around. We've experienced vast differences in what we are charged for identical coverage between companies. The last company we left wanted to double our rates because my license had been suspended. Except it hadn't. They wanted toe DMV to provide written proof that my license had never been suspended which is something they don't and can't do. There is no database listing all things you've never done. The insurance company Allstate claimed they got the info from some unnamed service that is never wrong. They argued for weeks until we left them for rates much lower than what we were paying even before they wanted to double our rates.;jk9lenm;dajt2;4vi6fv5g6
I don't know how traffic camera tickets work but at least for speeding tickets you can sometimes ask for a deferment. Basically you pay a bit more and the ticket stays off your public record but it comes back if you do get another ticket within that window.I did that when I hit a speeding ticket as a teenager and the waiting period was 7 years. I didn't get another ticket so it eventually fell off.So if you are generally a good driver check if that's an option if you get a ticket when you're young.;jkd7agb;p9qxi95o;dwj45

"My spouse (33) and I (36) are under contract for a $450000 house. We locked an interest rate of 6% with 20% down. Here are some key facts about our finances:Income - $190000Cash (checking + HYSA) - $183000Retirement accounts (traditional 401a Roth 403b) - $46000We are behind on retirement savings and plan to max out Roth IRAs this year along with continuing contributions to 401a and Roth 403b likely maxing out the latter through payroll deduction (401a contributions are fixed by the employer). We have no debts other than the mortgage.So our anticipated cash outflow/allocation is;20% down for the house - $90000 Closing costs - $10000 Roth IRAs - $13000 Emergency fund - $20000 House maintenance fund - $10000 That leaves almost $40000. My question is: should we increase downpayment to decrease the amount of loan @6% or should we invest these funds say in a taxable brokerage? We would buy and hold broad-based index funds like VTSAX which have a historical annual return much higher than 6%. We are pretty new at financial planning so any advice would be much appreciated.Edit: added the note about other debts.";13iwa1g;17mvm08;
"*""We would buy and hold broad-based index funds like VTSAX which have a historical annual return much higher than 6%.""*Over a long term this is true. The average American lives in their house for 7 years. Your chances of making more than 6% per annum in the market for the next 7 years are much much lower than you think. Fortunately/unfortunately people have grown up during the biggest gains in stock market history so people think the stock market is an easy win gold mine. Try telling that to people who invested in the stock market in 2000 (massive boom time) they didn't earn 1% gains overall until almost 15 years later. FIFTEEN YEARS.MIGHT you make more than 6% in the market? Possibly. You might also lose 6% per annum. Will you be GUARANTEED a 6% interest saving if you put that money down? Yes.

Jesus. Sometimes this subreddit makes me feel poor. I know I’m not but having 190k in cash is crazy to me.;jkdh2y8;ilna7;17mvm08
Look at it this way. Would you take a HELOC on the house to invest the money? Probably not and functionally you’re talking about doing the same exact thing. Plus between interest and PMI savings I’m not sure how you plan to profit on investing the money instead of paying down your 6% mortgage.;jkc21vt;7h1mkwmr;17mvm08
If I were in this situation I would put 20% down double your emergency fund and put in a HYSA then double your house maintenance fund in a separate HYSA. Then invest the rest.;jkd25bv;iu6ys;17mvm08

When interest rates eventually drop refinance and invest the extra after the refi.;jkcszfo;10wxef;17mvm08
You’ll get a lower rate at 19% down. Mortgage companies have rate sheets so you can likely get 5.875 at 19% down because they will make more in interest over 30 years. The monthly payment savings on the 5.875 might be greater than the PMI and you might have more flexibility with the $4500 you’ll save at 19% down.;jkcm4dm;w7t2alav;17mvm08
"**This one is easy.****So long as you're putting enough down to get out of PMI don't put a penny more than that even at 6%**. You still have about 30 years to retire and the compound interest on that money will destroy the simple interest loan in a home.Esp considering you are a *bit* behind for your age (not bad) but with as much time as you have get that money in the market as soon as you can.Compound interest over time is so much more powerful than the simple interest on a loan you'd have to make WELL below market expectations over the next 30 years to not be much much farther ahead having it in the market.**BTW - I did the math.**Putting an additional $40K down on the home will save you $239.82 a month and save you approximately $46K in interest payments. So you're paying $40K to save $46K which is a **116% return on the money**.Putting $40K into an index fund today for the next 30 years with 7% average rate of return (historical for the last 50 years is > 10%) will put $305K in your retirement account. After your $40K initial investment **that's a 661% return on your money.**Since inevitably people always ask ""*what if you invested the difference?*""If you put the $239.82 into an index fund same rate of return every month for 30 years you'd have $272K in your retirement account. However it cost you $86K to get that $272K. Subtracting the $86K from $272K gives you a 216% return.**So the answer is super clear. Put the money in the market.**";jkc2nzt;ckg1d;17mvm08
At 6% interest and your amount in savings I would put down 20% and max out all of your retirement accounts until you only have an emergency fund in savings;jkd41vm;4edpx;17mvm08
PMI is a good reason to pay extra on the loan;jkc0z2e;4eol4rn;17mvm08
Another commenter made the mathematical argument which I intellectually agree with (though having less debt sure can feel good).I'll just add that home ownership is expensive so I'd be sure to set aside a decent chuck up front for the inevitable maintenance and repairs and upgrades.;jkcp4zn;qd3r4;17mvm08
To get that rate did u buy down with points? I finished closing 2 weeks ago and I had 6.675% and no points. Wonder if rates are starting to slow down.;jkcycis;1kan9df6;17mvm08
What are your monthly expenses? Is $20k enough in the emergency fund? It’s best to have six months worth of expenses on hand. Even better to have a year’s worth. Expect that one day things will go south. Are you truly prepared?;jkd1dyv;7zea8i5hn;17mvm08
>should we increase downpayment to decrease the amount of loan @6%yes.  not only do you save interest but it's untaxed savings vs taxable capital gains;jkdd00d;t6qw4oky;17mvm08
$150K down and 15 year loan. Will give you an emergency fund and set you up with a fully owned home before you turn 50. You can accelerate savings when you’re ready.;jkdhm9t;muhgdc;17mvm08
At 6% and especially at a time when the market may be negative for a few years I'd take the guaranteed 6%. Now had you bought on 2021 and had 2.75% interest it would be a different story.;jkdj2cf;21ntqyk9;17mvm08
Emergency savings and make sure it’s in a hysa. Depending on the house condition and age something essential could go kaput and be very expensive to fix or replace.Let’s not forget what happened in 2008. I saw people suffer after their 401(k)s were wiped out because they were close to retirement age. Foreclosures galore because inflated home values equals more equity and banks were pushing HELOCs and home equity loans. When the housing bubble burst people that got HELOCS & home equity loans suddenly had no equity in their house which they viewed as an investment and could turn a profit when selling their home. I suspect we are heading into a bearish market so be conservative for now and keep that emergency fund plush.;jkdjny3;cx5wvnjp;17mvm08
I would hold on to that 40k for 6-10 months after the sale goes through in a HYSA then put it all on the mortgage. 6% is an amazing guaranteed rate of return especially because it doesn’t get taxed on capital gains. But I would keep liquid cash at a 4.5% rate in HYSA just in case something goes wrong with the house when you move in. Just promise yourself to not spend it on anything unnecessary only basic home repairs like plumbing or electric fixes or an hvac system or something.;jkdla4e;6b8xgbx1;17mvm08
If you can increase the down payment without effecting closing then go for it. 6% is a lot of interest to pay/avoid paying. Also no PMI that way. Better cash flow picture.;jkdn1m8;3id3a66c;17mvm08
Out of these two choices: pay 20% down. It’s a great possibility this is the beginning of a new secular trend of higher interest rates and stagflation which does not bode well for equity markets (margins compress). For an example of what this looks like for $SPY take a look at 69’-82’ where equities pretty much went sideways. Point is there will be some good buying opportunities in the future but now isn’t a good time in my opinion.;jkc1xlf;e1a9x;17mvm08
I'd do downpayment for several reasons.  1. If you do less than 20% you are going to be adding PMI on top of that 6% rate2. If you are investing into a taxable account you have to consider that any gains you do get will be cut by taxes so to match a 6% loan you are going to need more like a 7.5% return after cap gains and dividends3. Stock market returns may have averaged 10% historically over 50 years but there are definitely times where it averages far less than that (and sometimes like the last 10 years far more).  You are unlikely to be holding this house for 30 years probably more like 10 if that so over that period an average 7.5% return is far from guaranteed.4. Paying down at a 6% rate is a good guaranteed return and if it actually decreases the APR of your loan on top of that that is even better.;jkddbx6;54d01sls;17mvm08
"you wouldnt be an american if you didnt stretch yourself to buy a house.  just know that its not an investment and there is a greater than normal probability that it wont increase in value for a long time and may lose ""value"".  its somewhere for you to live for a long period of time. your job is to pay off the mortgage as quickly as you can. otherwise you'll be doubling your investment with interest and principal.";jkd77s5;9jev2xzm;17mvm08
An alternative strategy might be to invest the $40k via index funds and the pay what you would have saved monthly ($239.82) as an additional payment to attack the principal of the loan. You can always refinance in the future when interest rates drop.;jkd5v83;2jhhtjct;17mvm08
Is this your first home or just an upgrade? Keep in mind new furniture yard equipment etc etc. That all adds up and you want to just stick to 20% down. You can always pay extra each month if you’ve over estimated those expenses.;jkd2ef2;6fgp2bho6;17mvm08
I think you are underestimating your emergency fund and house fund. Just spit-balling your combined income over 12 months gives your E-fund just over a month of income. Not knowing how frugal you two live or expensive it is where you live. I would recommend beefing up that Emergency fund. A mortgage is the minimum amount you’re guaranteed to have to pay. Then include living expenses and times that by how many months out you want to have a safety net for. Houses require maintenance and if you are DIY thrifty or of a construction/ trades background I can see why only 10K for house repairs. If not you may deplete that and then some on one costly breakdown. Labor for house repairs isn’t cheap and those skills plus parts add up. Whatever way you decide to go about things best wishes. Stay well and boost that retirement.;jkd4zee;3xfilbjj;17mvm08
If you pay your mortgage on the time frame you set up say 20 years monthly you will end up paying nearly double the cost of the house.  Over that 20 year period you will need to see 100% increase in value to break even on your investment.If you can manage to pay it off sooner it's a massive savings for the two of you.  The money saved on your mortgage will far outweigh the gains of investment in my opinion  in the long run.;jkd50zi;14owdq;17mvm08
If you had already put that $40k toward the house would you pull it out to invest in the stock market?;jkdj89z;ilgwo;17mvm08
With your interest rate at 6% put it as downpayment. You aren’t guaranteed 6% in the stockmarket and we may be in for a flat market for the next few years.  If you had locked in a 3% rate before the hikes I would say stock market.  With that said you could invest the money in taxable accounts… that way you can tax lost harvest if the market takes a hit.  At least then you could deduct losses against your income. Also keep in mind rates may go back down so you can refinance later as well.  My guess is rates should be around 4-5 % in 2 years;jkdtuj4;b736vo2j;17mvm08
Yeah I'm in a similar situation as OP and am happy to accept the guaranteed 6%. If rates were 4% the story would probably be different;jkd5jjq;3lq2p;d7g0w
I agree with this. I’d also advise not “increasing your down payment.” Don’t mess with the loan as it stands especially if you’re close to closing. Just make an additional principal payment right away. Or better yet do it in pieces. New houses can have unexpected costs. Buy the house with 20% down and put the money in a high yield savings or no penalty cd. Settle in for a couple months ensure there’s nothing that requires immediate maintenance or attention. Get your furniture set up (though no need to rush to fill the place). Once you’ve got your (not so proverbial) house in order then make extra principal payments.;jkda4yz;mit47;d7g0w
Thanks for the sobering perspective. I am intellectually aware that investing in the market would be the (far) riskier option but it is helpful to read a specific example (people who invested in 2000).;jkddkqf;17mvm08;d7g0w
> The average American lives in their house for 7 years. This is an interesting statistic. Is this just homes that were bought or counting renters as well? Where I'm originally from house buying is usually 10 year minimum but usually a life thing. People save up all their life to be able to buy their home and very rarely leave it. Some upper middle class people (20s newly married etc) may buy for 10 years until the kids are teens and then they seem larger spaces.;jkdh16t;yo06d;d7g0w
Well that totally depends what you were investing in…;jkd0h0w;xdrto;d7g0w
This seems like very bad advice to me.  There are times in the market where things go down but there are often times where things come roaring back.  Your prediction about the next five years doesn't match mine.  It's almost like you shouldn't guess and try to time the market you should just plan with traditional returns in mind and invest for the long term.  In that case the OP is completely correct to assume greater than 6% returns in the US stock market.  That doesn't mean he will get them of course but planning pessimistically instead of with data is worse than not planning at all IMO.This type of thinking is the opposite of mine and as it is the top comment I just wanted to provide a counter point.;jkdo5pv;yq2l1;d7g0w
This has largely been accidental because we had no clue what we were doing. Fo over 6 years I did not contribute to 401k offered by my previous employer. So the money kept sitting gathering dust in checking accounts. I wish I knew back then what I know now.;jkdkz5s;17mvm08;ilna7
"OP is 33 and saying ""Behind on retirement contributions"" I just started this a decade later than OP haha";jkds1ds;k4hqpnyj;ilna7
Not even close. HELOC is a compound interest loan Mortgage loan is simple interest. Very very different.Second the return on the market VASTLY outperforms the pre-calculated interest on a home loan. You'd have to see returns over a 30 year period like 2% ARR to match the 6% on a mortgage.;jkc2rxm;ckg1d;7h1mkwmr
I agree — this emergency fund seems conservative. In fact I would work to build a _second_ emergency fund for the home specifically. House maintenance is a different story.;jkdapta;37ybs;iu6ys
Thanks for the suggestion. We are definitely thinking of increasing the house maintenance fund now. I have seen rules of thumb that suggest keeping 1% or so in house fund which is why I thought $10k might be adequate.;jkdh5il;17mvm08;10wxef
"Yep.  On a $450k house several ""one thing""s are probably $10k (roof AC Furnace deck driveway).  Then a lot of things are $2k-$5k (dishwasher fridge painting dealing with a downed tree Homeowner's deductible leak fixes.)  In the first few years it is very easy to need one big thing and 2-3 smaller things.";jkdg8a4;dqa3y;10wxef
**If** interest rates drop. I think they probably will at some point but there’s no guarantee of that whatsoever. We’re at a pretty average interest rate / mortgage rate environment.;jkdnguu;5wpkv;10wxef
You are correct that a 7% return is better than a 6% return. Although the 7% is risked and the 6% is guaranteed.However your math is incomplete as option “pay down debt” should include those monthly savings going towards a DCA investment bucket and include your same compound rate premise in option 2.Similarly option “Wall Street bets” should include the increased mortgage payments incurred and deducted from the compounding effect. This will bring your outcomes far closer each other and reality. There are also tax and interest complications which muddy this and make this far less of a “no-brainer”In fact if OP has a lack of experience in investing  there’s is a reasonable expectation that they will not have the confidence to hold during market downturns and not realize the “average” market return. In this case they would be better off paying down the mortgage;jkcfbie;dyro9ztn;ckg1d
"this is terrible logic.  you assume 100% risk of attempting to ""average"" a 7% return vs. paying for an asset that you owe money on and want to own.";jkd7gvr;9jev2xzm;ckg1d
Your analysis is not really accurate. You may have “done the math” but you mostly did it wrong by comparing the wrong things. You have not once mentioned probably the single most important factor which is tax avoidance.  Put the money in tax advantages retirement plans is the right answer - not just the market. Currently they are holding cash so they need to live on that cash and increase their ROTH and 403b contributions.You also co mingled two topics - the interest paid on the loan and the amount they would earn in the market from the decreased loan payment. the amount of money they would have from investing the difference in their lower monthly payment is the direct result of paying less interest. A better analysis would have been the second half of your presentation which was investing the $40k now ending with $305k. You failed to a knowledge this was a money market account due to the fact they already have the cash. Profit 305-40= $265k.  Net $305 -(20%x$265k) = $252000.   But you did not compare this against tax advantages plans. Imagine that $272k you calculated for investing the $239.82 monthly was in a Roth. $272k tax free. I digress. Put the money in the market through tax advantage retirement plans. I could be wrong please double check my math.;jkd2uff;dfox4;ckg1d
$46000 in retirement in your mid 30s for two people isn’t a “bit” behind.  They are extremely behind.If they are able to financially max out every year they’ll be fine.;jkcjhjl;btzygsa6;ckg1d
"This is bad advice.  You are comparing the guaranteed 6% return from paying down the loan with the speculative return from investing in the stock market.

Very long (and misleading) post to say that if you take the $40K and invest it at 7% (as you say more than likely but not guaranteed) you end up with $305K while if instead you use the $40K decrease the amount you borrow at 6% that you end up with 272K.    Ignores the fact that the downpayment will often get you a lower rate and/or avoid paying PMI.;jkd41di;113cwm;ckg1d
You also lower your taxable income with the interest paid if you itemize your taxes which adds an unknown value. 20k today has more purchasing power than the 20k you pay back over 30 years if they choose not to invest.;jkcquvn;v5lsrnzv;ckg1d
The 6% is guaranteed whereas the return from the market is anything but;jkdcwfx;3lq2p;ckg1d
Agree.One more thing. With inflation running high you will be paying the mortgage off in future years with less valuable money.Also having less of a down payment increases your leverage.  It’s not likely you will live in this house for 30 years.  Say you sell the house in 7 years for $40k more.  That’s a 100% return on your investment.  If you had put $80k down only 50% return.;jkdhd15;4pr2inhw;ckg1d
Appears PMI is covered and they still have $40K excess. If so they should invest the rest.;jkc2vb2;ckg1d;4eol4rn
We already have that covered by paying at least 20% down.;jkdaf7r;17mvm08;4eol4rn
Estimated monthly expenses with the above mortgage are <$7000. With stable jobs we feel that $20k is a good starting point and plan to increase EF to 6 mo living expenses over the next few months.;jkdaxbi;17mvm08;7zea8i5hn
We currently rent the house so by and large we know what is coming (also thanks to the home and sewer inspection). The electric fixtures would need updating in the near future and a few other minor repairs but otherwise the house is in a good condition. It was updated 4 years ago so most appliances etc are in good condition. Nevertheless we plan on increasing the house maintenance fund for the unknown unknowns.;jkdqyt4;17mvm08;6b8xgbx1
Agreed. Certain stocks are bullish but the overall equity market is trending bearish.;jkdhhm8;cx5wvnjp;e1a9x
All valid points very clearly stated. thank you.;jkdlu7m;17mvm08;54d01sls
Thanks for your thoughts. Our estimated monthly expenses are below $7000 so EF represents just under 3 mo of expenses. After reading your and other comments we plan to increase EF over the next few months but $20000 is what we would start with. I also edited the post to note that we have very stable university jobs which was my reasoning behind a low-ish initial EF. Point taken about house fund. We are not handy at all so we will increase the house fund significantly. We are buying the house we currently rent so we sort of know that it is in a good condition (based on last 9 months of observing). But shit can break any day so it makes sense to be prepared.;jkd9ds7;17mvm08;3xfilbjj
Good to know! Best wishes with your new home.;jkdeohq;17mvm08;3lq2p
Would you mind elaborating? Why is it not good to mess with the loan close to closing? We have had very good experience with our mortgage broker so far and have been assuming that if we were to suggest this he would be forthright in his advice.;jkde2a4;17mvm08;mit47
Right. I lived it so it's fresh in my memory so I'm careful never to forget how bad things can be. I've lived through multiple recessions. In 2008 I had SOOO many colleagues acquaintances etc. who claimed they were in it for the long haul who panic-sold all of their portfolios and sat on cash and obliterated their entire lifetime potential gains. This is not raw numbers this is people's lives and when things get hairy people act emotionally. The market is a great tool for building wealth but it's far from smooth sailing.;jkdjx0o;d7g0w;17mvm08
In the US people move constantly primarily due to job changes.;jkdjcf4;d7g0w;yo06d
I work in finance full time 10 hours/day. I attend extensive market training and have apt certifications. I would say I am more aware of market conditions than 95% of people. Our investment firm and other colleagues as of currently pretty much agree the usual 8% returns per year will not happen until inflation is near 2% and interest rates are near 2.5% which we are 4-6 years out from. Bonds are currently your best option and that can give you nearly 5% returns. But that won’t be every year and you can only lock in 3.8% right now on a 30 year or 3.5% on a 10 year.;jkd1ez8;8kceswi8;xdrto
Im 28. I feel like I’m financially ok for the first time in my life. I have about 30k in 401k and 20k in cash. I need a middle class personal finance subreddit. I can’t even imagine having 190k or buying a 400k house.;jkdnxml;ilna7;17mvm08
> Fo over 6 years I did not contribute to 401k offered by my previous employerDid you lose out on any company 401k match since you contributed 0%?I don't mean to kick you when you are feeling down but I can't imagine missing out on free company match for over 6 years.;jkdsber;el2bs;17mvm08
"That's just not true.  Interest on a HELOC and mortgage is calculated the same for every month:interest = (balance after last month's payment) \* (interest rate) / 12.&#x200B;You cannot count on the market to go up consistently.  The market can and does have flat to down periods of a decade or more.  Investors have gotten spoiled by the recent long term bull markets and need to understand that trees don't grow to the sky.A much more prudent strategy would be to put more money down on the house giving a lower monthly payment and then investing that payment difference every month.  That reduces the risk of a down market hurting them and allows them to 'dollar cost average' (when the market is down they buy more shares) which means that they would actually benefit from market volatility as they are investing.";jkd4lt3;w4tscltz;ckg1d
But you forget that 6% of let say 100k loan compared to a 1 million dollar loan are two different things. You can’t just look at interest rate. If you put more money down you are getting a free 6% return on the money that you have compared to the bank making 6% off of you a year. Conservative estimate is 7% return a year I would put more down at 6% interest rate.;jkd0tsi;bwbhbd;ckg1d
Yeah but I mean in 30 years they'll probably drop;jkdo3dl;10wxef;5wpkv
>You are correct that a 7% return is better than a 6% return. Although the 7% is risked and the 6% is guaranteed.I second this opinion as I'd rather take 6% guaranteed return vs. 7% higher-risk return.  Lot of people learned the hard way during 2008 that loans don't get halved just because their investments did.  However I'm recommending to keep the down payment at 20% in this case because the OP seems to be behind his retirement savings and will also need to up the emergency savings to deal with unexpected house repairs.;jkdjbbz;sdjolbxx;dyro9ztn
">You are correct that a 7% return is better than a 6% return.LOL dude wrote 8 paragraphs to say ""investing at 7% will yield you slightly more than investing at 6%""";jkd455o;113cwm;dyro9ztn
That asset could be a risk or liability as well though;jkd8a9f;11ai9s;9jev2xzm
The way the post was formatted I thought they had $183k in retirement (I see now that is cash) and thought “well damn if that’s behind the most of America is fucked.”Yeah $46k at that age puts them in a real tough spot they’re going to have to get real aggressive about it unless they have a pension or something.;jkctlho;8i6vr1k7;btzygsa6
Well it’s $229000 in savings. It doesn’t make a ton of difference whether it’s currently in a retirement account.;jkd7wpa;7kdpd;btzygsa6
DCA just reduces risk it doesn’t really benefit from market volatility it just tries to reduce the impact of it.;jkdprmp;5wpkv;w4tscltz
PMI and lower rate are probably not relevant because they’re talking about increasing their down payment above 20% vs. keeping it at 20%;jkdpyix;5wpkv;113cwm
No one is going to be itemizing on a $450k mortgage after 20% down in the current tax code;jkd1zf4;t7ajiglw;v5lsrnzv
at a mortgage rate of 6% it's not clear to me that the average investment gains of 10% that it's better to invest instead of paying down principal.When we had a 6.5% mortgage back in the 90s we did both -- both paying extra towards principal and investing.  It doesn't have to be either-or.;jkdb6f0;4eol4rn;ckg1d
Oh if this is a rental then you should absolutely put it all on the house and really shouldn’t be buying a rental unless you have cash especially a $450k rental at a 6% mortgage. Your margin will be pretty tight I doubt you’ll be making enough income to justify the huge amount of risk you’ll have. You should also have a much larger emergency savings and maintenance fund. Is this your first rental? Do you have any other debts? If one system on this house goes it could easily wipe out all of your emergency savings and if one system on this house goes at the same time as one on your primary home you’ll have to sell this in a really bad position.;jkdvoji;6b8xgbx1;17mvm08
Any disruptions could simply complicate closing. The advice above is spot on imo however paying the principle will help you pay off the loan faster but not reduce your monthly mortgage while reworking the loan with a larger down will.;jkdekw5;8zde8;17mvm08
Idk about you but I just bought a 460k house. Had 4k because the electric was old 2k because light fixtures were ugly 1k because it was staged and didn't have things like towel racks shower curtain plus rod in weird sizes all the curtain rods and curtains the closets were small so 1k in furniture/shelving. A 2k shed 5k in sewer compliance and 2k in sidewalk compliance.Some of this I knew in advance but man some I didn't. If I could time travel I would keep more in reserve. Also... my closing costs were a lot more than that. Maybe that's an area thing or because I had less down...;jkdkuum;qwuxy;17mvm08
"Your loan interest rate is ""locked"" but dependent on all the details that you've given to the broker thus far. You got your interest rate based on your creditworthiness but also based on the value of the house and the downpayment you're putting down. While logic might indicate that more downpayment is safer for the bank it also means less profit for them. So sometimes larger downpayments *don't* equal a smaller interest rate. And although they told you your rate is ""locked"" if you mess with any of the origination details then there are provisions for the bank to renege. &#x200B;I don't have your mortgage docs in front of me and it is certainly totally fine to call your broker and ask about the implications of changing the down payment. It might be totally fine on their end. The other thing to consider is your closing date. Changing the downpayment will change a bunch of numbers on the bank side but that flows through down to your title company who handles the calculations. This won't just change your monthly payment but also the amount of prepaid interest that you owe and the interest on days 1-X of your closing date etc.   Basically there's a domino effect that leads to all the closing documents and calculations having to be redone. This can take time and in the event of any mistakes (I found mistakes on my closing docs!!!) if you push your closing date that can obviously be problematic for many reasons (seller gets mad calculations have to change AGAIN). The date of closing and each dollar amount is tied together.&#x200B;At my home's closing the title company had a discrepancy in their numbers of ONE CENT. It took them two hours to figure out and correct the issue and it held up the sale of the house in the process (even though the seller's agent took out a penny and offered it lol).  The one down side to waiting on making the payment as another comment pointed out is that your monthly payment will remain what it currently looks to be. Whereas making a larger downpayment will reduce it for the life of the loan. &#x200B;So if you have >2 weeks until your closing and your broker indicates that no rate change will occur as a result then it may be fine to go ahead and have them change the documents. But just be prepared to have to recheck all the paperwork again when it's regenerated by all the parties. &#x200B;Always check their work! Title companies are not infallible.";jkdhvlf;mit47;17mvm08
Essentially you will have to start the closing process over. Unless you are really early in the process.;jkdmu2x;3id3a66c;17mvm08
I bought several houses both personal residence and investment properties and in both scenarios I wouldn’t mess with the mortgage.  Especially in an environment with rising rates and bank failures.  The banks take a dim view of this and it may delay the closing.   As for investments I am more defensive where I need to be and aggressive in certain areas.

"I am a fan of Jack Bogle and ""A simple path to wealth"" so intellectually I believe that I will stay the course but then I have never actually experienced a situation like 2000 or 2008 with my investments. Better to doubt one's own psyche and build defenses against own bad behavior.";jkdopmc;17mvm08;d7g0w
I was in your shoes at 28 except no cash nor emergency fund. 10 years later and my situation is way closer to OP. Steady salary increases and not buying stupid crap/new cars is what got me there.;jkdr8eb;10lvhk;ilna7
We each have our own journey and who knows what the future holds. If I could go back and talk to my 28 year old self I would tell him to put as much as reasonably feasible in 401k and IRA. Then we would not have 190k sitting in cash but the retirement prospects would be looking much better.;jkdrvei;17mvm08;ilna7
I believe I did. I don't have the plan information from my old employer but I am sure I left money at the table by not contributing. Wish I was more aware of this stuff back then but hey better late than never. Luckily our salaries have increased significantly since (almost 1.6x) while expenses have not increased as much. Looks like our savings rate is well over 40% even after buying the house and paying for very expensive childcare.;jkdvdzd;17mvm08;el2bs
They could. Or not. They were higher for all of 1970-2000. I think they’ll probably drop in the next 30 year span but no one knows really. I do imagine we’ll hit an economic crisis again that requires dropping fed rates back to near 0 though.;jkdr7e4;5wpkv;10wxef
its not an investment.  its a long term primary residence to provide shelter.;jkd8j58;9jev2xzm;11ai9s
The loan is a fixed liability. And any extra payments have a fixed return with no risk.The house does have risk but that risk is the same whether you choose to invest in the market or pay down the loan. You have 100% exposure regardless.;jkdn8wm;g9xby;11ai9s
Yea a general rule of thumb I heard is 1x salary saved by 30 and 3x salary saved by 40. Luckily they have a high salary so they should be able to allocate a higher percentage to savings.;jkdbrdf;7c5na;8i6vr1k7
Cash is fungible.  Money saved in taxable accounts can still be spent in retirement.  Yes it’s best to have the money in tax deferred savings accounts but it’s not like you can’t use the $183 k in retirement too.;jkdgwoz;4pr2inhw;8i6vr1k7
That's right. We are very unlikely to itemize with the standard deduction at the levels it is at.;jkdf0l5;17mvm08;t7ajiglw
That's a VERY general statement. I itemize. I have a house for 250 one for 100 but I also have 2 business loans and deductions (mileage food expenses etc) every year.;jkdks2g;v5lsrnzv;t7ajiglw
This is our primary home and we are first time buyers. Point well taken about increasing maintenance funds since that applies as much to primary residence as on rentals.;jkdw39r;17mvm08;6b8xgbx1
> paying the principle will help you pay off the loan faster but not reduce your monthly mortgage while reworking the loan with a larger down will.  A very good point that I should have included!;jkdgh64;mit47;8zde8
We actually rent this house now so we are very familiar with the condition which is actually pretty decent. We do anticipate some specific repairs and a roof replacement at some point but the near term looks OK. Nevertheless I am planning on increasing the house maintenance fund because that seems to be a universal advice in comments here.;jkdpcwe;17mvm08;qwuxy
When I bought my house my mortgage broker strongly advised keeping a larger reserve paying the minimum down payment needed to secure the best rate and nothing more. Of course this benefits the bank with more financed but I was so grateful when I found out I needed to make repairs in the first week for compliance replace a failed HVAC system not identified correctly in the home inspection and more. I had the cash reserves to do what was needed without it being damaging to me.;jkdn9su;1iiovva2;qwuxy
Really appreciate the detailed response. We have just about 2 weeks left for closing but I think if we were to suggest this out broker could get it done within a few days. This is assuming that the lender will not increase the rates.That's a crazy story about waiting 2 hours for 1 cent difference.;jkdkbl6;17mvm08;mit47
We are about half way through. Appraisal is today (starting a few minutes actually) and we have the inspections done. We received the closing disclosure late last week.;jkdpn5d;17mvm08;3id3a66c
I did buy a new car. My 2008 car died and I was able to get an employee discount. Felt like a good time to do it;jkdrih0;ilna7;10lvhk
Glad you have a positive outlook and 40% savings rate will play out well in the long run.I do my best to inform new hires in my group what our benefits are and that we have a 10% 401k match if they also put in 10%. The best asset they have on their side is time and investing early and investing often.;jkdvtgz;el2bs;17mvm08
True but the amount of space you have in tax advantaged accounts if finite. Once the year is up you can't get it back. So those last 10-15 years of working where they were leaving space on the table are gone forever.;jkdir8p;8i6vr1k7;4pr2inhw
Business vs. personal stuff is different. You can itemize business expenses while taking the standard deduction. You cannot itemize personal expenses while taking the standard deduction;jkdqcmi;5wpkv;v5lsrnzv
Oh I was very confused about the rental situation. I read it wrong. I thought you were renting this home to someone else but you were living in this home as a rental and now purchasing it. Well I would still be putting more in to emergency but nothing dramatically different. Maybe another 10-15k.;jkdwqg9;6b8xgbx1;17mvm08
The house maintenance fund should be a regular budget line item. I have often seen 1-3% home value per year as a target.;jkds8ys;o1ipd;17mvm08
Yeah - you're pretty far into the process. Maybe call the title company and explain your interests and see if they say it will be a problem or cause any delay. If not do it.I can understand wanting a lower monthly payment. The idea of a larger down payment in your case makes perfect sense if you can do it without jeopardizing closing.   If you can't do it without impacting closing then I would buy a 12-month CD or T-Bill at ~4-6% then refinance after the 12 months (you probably can't refinance sooner than 12-months due to the 'occupancy clause') rolling in the balance of the CD against the new loan amount. In the end you will be in roughly the same position as if you made a larger down payment. Be aware that refinancing does incur new costs. So don't worry - you do have options.;jkdr0pv;3id3a66c;17mvm08
I had the exact same conversation yesterday with a new employee in my group about our retirement plans. I do not want them to repeat my mistakes.;jkdwauv;17mvm08;el2bs
But they could max it every year until the money they have in taxable accounts has been essentially transferred to the tax advantaged accounts. So it’s really only an issue if they would be maxing out every year anyway in which case they’d be putting away plenty.;jkdneh2;7kdpd;8i6vr1k7
I’m 22 4 Months away from college graduation. I come from a developing country in Africa so it’s pretty impossible to land a Job. I’ve polished my skills(Data analysis Matlab Python & R Web Dev) and while I was a student I could make up to $500 per month which could pay my bills. It’s been two months living on my savings $0 earnings and I’m down to financial stress.;13iumfd;qi5adjyi;
Those are pretty good skills to have. They should be valuable in a remote working environment. Have you looked into Fiver at all?;jkbs2a8;15mmo5;qi5adjyi
I’ve tried Upwork;jkbs5ze;qi5adjyi;15mmo5
Oh my gosh! That is very hard situation..Especially to you..Your a college student? Am I right? Then yes.it gives you more stress..And I know it's difficult to you to understand your situation.;jkdob2g;vl5z0amv;15mmo5
I am looking to get some life insurance to protect my family. I’m looking for around $1 million in coverage. I currently have $350k for $260 annually through my employer($20/month). I received a quote through policygenius for private for much higher than what I was expecting. I do have a few health issues. They gave me a quote of 1 million coverage for $1175 annually. This is about $99/month. They also quoted me $500k coverage for $55/month. Should I get less private coverage and increase my coverage through my employer? I think I can get up to $500k through my employer. Or would it be better to get the million through private insurance and drop my employee benefit?;13iqauf;4ef89o27;
One issue with the employer's insurance is that coverage ends with your employment;jkb4695;4tjc93zj;4ef89o27
>Should I get less private coverage and increase my coverage through my employer?Both.  Get a baseline amount through private insurance and supplement with group life;jkb456c;6k6nr;4ef89o27
Get 1 mil private and 500k employer.Talk to an independent insurance agent to get quotes.;jkb78nr;47kuj;4ef89o27
"""Group"" life insurance through your employer will be cheaper if you have health issues. Generally above a certain amount you'll end up having to submit a health form to your employer as well for the supplemental coverage. Also the rates for supplemental may not be as good as the basic. One thing to note is there can be coverage differences between policies. Notable would be:  - Accelerated benefit for terminal conditions  - Coverage for suicide or other certain causes of death or circumstancesAlso look at the continuation rates for your employer coverage. You'll be paying that if you leave and you'll be trapped if your health worsens.";jkbf6nu;hiaup;4ef89o27
One thing to consider is to get multiple policies of varying lengths.  Assuming your children are very young under say 3 you could get a 20 year term for say 500k and another 10 year term for another 500k assuming that you are able to save and invest during that time.  Idea being that your family will not need the full million (adjusted for inflation) towards the tail end of the 20 year term because you would have been saving investing paying down mortgage college savings ect.Also be aware that there is also SS survivor benefits for your minor children under the age of 18 and guardian. You can log into your SSA account to see the maximum benefits.  Last time I looked at mine the max family benefit was around $5k per month.  Take that into consideration when calculating how much life insurance to purchase.https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/survivors/ifyou.html;jkbyvj4;14d7vg;4ef89o27
Many/most are portable. OP should read his policy and understand how to convert the coverage upon termination of employment.;jkb5m2l;getfb;4tjc93zj
I am looking to meet with a financial advisor before putting in an offer on a house that comes on the market THIS FRIDAY😳.  We are first time home buyersWe are in the fortunate position (through setting and forgetting an % of income that directs to savings) that we could actually just pay cash (but probably wouldn’t).Is there a type of advisor who could help us understand if we are making a smart decision and staying within a budget required to also stay on track for retirement?Despite large savings we are not the most financially literate and I think we need help if we want to move this quickly to make sure we don’t somehow undo decades of hard earned savings. In short:  HELP ME I don’t know what I am doing!;13ieqn5;v4fwjs1k;
