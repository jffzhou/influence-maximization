"Hey guys! About a month ago I made a post telling how frustrated I was after getting many rejections. I would like to thank each and every one of you who sent me comforting messages made me not give up and keep tryingI would like to say that I have good news I received two job offers today! I sent 150 resumes and did 11 interviews. I would like to share with you the methods I used to be more successful in interviews.I ended up redoing my entire resume. With the help of ChatGPT I rewrote some of the texts to have a more captivating approach (It's all about doing marketing). Instead of putting phrases like ""I maintained a SaaS platform""  I started to write something like ""I maintained a SaaS platform used by more than 30000 users from 40 different countries"" one of the interviewers liked this approach a lot as it gives more strength to the work that I did due to the responsibility. There are several handbooks that help you study for interviews. If you are a front-end developer I advise you to read the ""Front-end Interview Handbook"": [Link here](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/)In most of the technical interviews I conducted they asked me some of the questions that are in the handbook I mentioned. I spent two weeks answering all the questions in this document and created some codepens with code examples to understand several of these concepts. The same can be done for the backend in case you are a web developer.If during the interview you don't know a specific question don't be salient sometimes I followed that approach ""I don't know specifically what functionality X does but I know how Y and Z work and they are correlated "".";13ifdbp;bpclc2lk;

Can you post your resume? 11 interviews in 150 apps is very good. As a new grad I'm at almost 200 applications with 0 interviews;jka8fmv;dkxm55de;bpclc2lk
Were you only cold applying or reaching out to people at these companies?   What was your process in actually getting interviews? I'm at almost 200 applications and only had two interviews which both canceled at the last minute.;jka1jam;cbfvc;bpclc2lk

"I had two interviews because of referrals. The other 9 interviews happened because I applied ""randomly"" to a lot of jobs The website I used the most during my search was this one: https://otta.com/Otta's UI/UX is a lot better than LinkedIn's UI/UX. And some of the offers you find there are not on LinkedIn so there may be more chances of getting an interviewYou can also select your favorite technologies. You will find a lot of new startups and remote jobs in there";jka2tny;bpclc2lk;cbfvc

Wow did yours????;jk9oev3;6kg0cp5i;a9x29bs4g
If you are a student with only student projects what should you do instead? I tried to put as many number stats as possible like the size of datasets I was working with accuracy of classification. (Applying to data science rolls) But idk what else I could do.;jka5u91;g4pjm;a9x29bs4g

"Sometimes I would prompt something like this:""Generate me a small text which emphasizes numbers based on the following text: I helped to maintain a SaaS platformAnd chatGPT would generate me something like:""I played a pivotal role in maintaining a high-performing SaaS platform ensuring uptime of 99.9% and reducing average response time by 25%. Additionally I collaborated with cross-functional teams to conduct bi-monthly audits and maintain compliance with industry standards resulting in a 98% customer satisfaction rating.""Then just put the pieces together and remove the texts that don't make much sense";jk9zkav;bpclc2lk;6h5bayax
I actually worked at a SaaS platform but the numbers are fake I just wanted to give an example;jkca79x;bpclc2lk;a5rfhn4l
I did 150-200 apps 2 interviews and 1 offer‚Ä¶ it sucks until it doesn‚Äôt I guess. But still sucks getting rejected so much.;jkb6eea;7jw4x;8zwf81m3
It really is just a resume problem for them. Most of the job description in question should be on a resume. That will probably warrant at least a recruiter call if the job posting was recent enough. Most of the recruiters I've been able to talk to mainly just look for the skillset and desirable traits passed down to them from a hiring manager and all of those skillsets and traits are usually right in the job description.;jkb6ico;1n82bhe;8zwf81m3
Thanks for replying! I haven‚Äôt heard of otta but will check them out right now.   When cold applying did you apply to jobs that are newly posted vs older postings? I heard some companies have a soft cut off after they receive x amount of applications;jka3w4j;cbfvc;bpclc2lk
Can you share if the jobs you got were the ones you lead through referrals?;jkb5xv0;smath;bpclc2lk

Absolutely. We need to to graduate senior year.;jk9pz4x;a9x29bs4g;6kg0cp5i
"This is a common course in most respectable universities. Usually called something like ""professional communications"" or something similar. It covered how to give professional presentations interviews and resumes. Yeah putting tangible numbers on your resume is a huge plus. Actual dollar amounts user counts elapsed time savings/performance percentages - people love it. ""Completed a Six Sigma Yellowbelt project saving the company $130k per year"" people melt over that.Edit: To those without a dedicated class or didn't take the class because it was optional - You should still have some form of a ""career center"". This ""career center"" is responsible for helping with things like mock interviews interview training resume workshops internship/co-op guidance and job opportunities (like career fairs). You should seek them out and get their input.";jkba4qt;67i6u;6kg0cp5i
If I see a stat padded resume like that from a starter the only thing I'll think of that is that they read somewhere online that that was a good idea. What I always look for is willingness to learn interest in the work that we do and a sense of professionalism. Realistically a junior will mostly be learning stuff so I want someone who is excited to pick up and learn new things and also easy to communicate with during that process. It's nice if you managed to train a sweet random forest and managed to squeeze out some high F1 score but that isn't worth shit if I feel like you're a pain to work with.;jkaohnx;60m6e;g4pjm

Mine did and gave me dumb advice. Basically ‚Äúyou need to use our format everything else is wrong‚Äù so your mileage may vary.;jkcm3ag;3w2cm;a9x29bs4g
"You know this advice is completely worthless at every stage besides the interview where it's only actionable as ""don't be an asshole and ask questions."" I mean what you're really saying is that you ding college kids for taking advice from people who know more than them and then saying that the point of hiring college kids is for them to take advice from people who know more than them?";jkartxa;qaixi;60m6e
I feel like this and soft skills like communication are my strengths. But I have no way to even get to the stage to show this off cause I can't get any interviews. How would you even demonstrate this on a resume?;jkau2az;g4pjm;60m6e
How much time do you spend screening each resume?;jkb4tf6;kbkjyohg;60m6e
"I'd suggest:1/ Moving projects and XP above skills.2/ Combine Leadership & Involvement section and your Work Experience. At first glance it looks like you are trying to double list the same position. Just specify it as Working Experience with a new title and details.3/ Your details are lacking not in substance but in value. You've also over compensated in some substance. For example...StressFree Mobile Application""Small team development using Dart on Flutter framework""""Using Agile methodology completed 8 user epics across 3 sprints""""Allow users to manage stress via journaling stress relif videos...""The team has nothing to do with your framework. Separate them and don't specify the size of the team. The sprints mean nothing different teams have different sprint sizes and lengths same with epics. 3 sprints is nothing to most people. Your last sentence is great it is the most meaningful sentence there.Instead I'd rewrite the StressFree Mobile entry as:> Mobile application built with Dart on Flutter> Allows user to manage stress via journaling [....details]> Close collaboration in fast-pace environment using agile methodology.Parts of Speech Tagger add some marking to your verbiage...> Predictive speech learning application which trains from tagged input> Implemented rules engine to apply accuracy enhancement to training results increasing accuracy by 93%.Book Similarity Core Calculator> Design mathematical application for indexing and searching media by calculated coefficients> Utilizes term-by-document co-occurence matrix to calculate pairwise cosine similarity scores> Achieves [some metric for scoring whatever it's usability is why it is valuable]So on... You don't have to say it is python. Matter of a fact it looks worse. Your skills specify other languages (and other languages first) but all your projects start with ""Python project..."". So it leaves the impression that all you know is python. So leave that out. Just mention the complexities value purpose of the projects.Otherwise pretty good. Just need some marketing jazz added as noted above. Once you get that relevant experience move the education to the bottom experience to the top skills can stay in the middle but over time it should fade with a robust experience list.";jkbtyr7;67i6u;dkxm55de
"I want to spare you from a wall of text containing a ton of pedantic comments about your resume because you already have that. I'll just note one thing that I don't explicitly see anywhere and that is you really need to step into the shoes of someone who is running a dev team building enterprise software and ask yourself would this person really want you on their team. Every single word on your resume needs to be both applicable and have market value.I know you don't have any real experience but to be 100% honest with you I'm  not really interested in about half of your resume. The lab tech stuff takes up about 40-45% of your resume and it doesn't really add value to you as an entry level developer. You're not going to be placed in leadership positions. I understand the experience was valuable to you personally but 9 times out of 10 actual experience or a real project is going to pay off much more. I'd condense that \~45% into about 5-15% and fill in the rest with another project and even more ideally an actual internship/job (even if it's unpaid / part-time).To expand on the last point you have stuff like 8 user epics across 3 sprints and that doesn't really seem very appealing.""Developed complex algorithms to calculate key financial metrics including... standard deviation"".... really? standard deviation is complex?""developed the back-end architecture of the application""... okay but what does the backend actually achieve behaviorally and functionally? Are they microservices? How many users can you support 10? 100? 1000? What's the DB layer what language is the backend written in etc...? The point isn't to be pedantic about the words... the point is you need to include more meaningful metrics and details about the projects right now nothing about these bulletpoints stands out at all except maybe 2/8 of them. Here's an example of a bullet point that would actually stand out:""Designed and implemented several Java microservices using Spring Boot and Firebase which leverages a Redis write-through cache and a performance-optimized Postgres database to securely support thousands of concurrent low-latency transactions.""\-> that's what a backend architecture sounds like.And where is this architecture you speak of I see your github is completely blank? You're going to want to ensure AT LEAST your resume projects are all up on github with very clear documentation gifs/videos of demos build/usage instructions architecture diagrams (if any) and code comments. it honestly shouldn't take long to do this maybe a few days tops and it goes a long way (I look at candidates' Githubs).";jkbwowq;1n82bhe;dkxm55de

You can't really. I'm someone who also has stronger soft skills and struggled getting my first internships but once i got my foot in the door at my first position having strong soft skills are amplified because you've already proven you can do the job so there's less uncertainty there.

I know there‚Äôs a variety of people on this subreddit from all walks of life so I was curious: what reasons made you want to become a programmer or enter into computer science in general?;13iaxtu;t8i3l3lk;
I liked video games which led into me liking computers which led into me learning how to make a website for fun which led into me choosing to get a CS degree which led me into getting a job as a software engineer.;jk8wk24;ubb8r7jp;t8i3l3lk
Anecdotally older folks who have been at it for a long time seem to have gotten into it from exposure to programming from young age and younger folks seem to have gotten into it because money.For me I found out that programming is a tinkerer's dream with lots of cool things to explore and without any of the costs of tinkering w/ physical things.;jk8ww5j;3htbf;t8i3l3lk
grew up poor like computersgo college math class hard part-time jobs hard computer programming classes.. fun? get job making software for money low-stress very enjoyable good money no wanna quit;jk8z80m;kntxd;t8i3l3lk
Simply put I enjoy programming. If CS didn‚Äôt pay amazingly well however I would have studied something else. I‚Äôm not one of those to live paycheck to paycheck. I wanted financial stability and be able to do and buy whatever I want at any given point in time.;jk8ze8a;r1cb5l8;t8i3l3lk
Money‚Ä¶haha. More specifically ‚Äî I was looking for a career to support our family while my husband was in the process of a (long-anticipated) career change.I quickly discovered it was exactly the sort of career I should have picked for myself 15+ years ago. I love a good brain challenge and I get that every day I‚Äôm at work.;jk8zfpg;12z23z;t8i3l3lk
I started out working toward medical school but when I looked at the amount of schooling and debt ahead of me I decided not to pursue it. I didn't really know what else to do and my dad suggested I try CS because he was seeing companies start to ramp up hiring of devs.I had no other ideas so I rolled with it and switched from Chemistry to CS after my first semester. Ended up somewhat enjoying the material and being good at it. Now here we are.So I didn't have plans to go into dev. Just kinda ended up here. Glad I did.;jk8ydtm;9hevu8wf4;t8i3l3lk
It was fun and creative and made me feel like a sorcerer :);jk919p8;k1fxu;t8i3l3lk
The ladies‚Ä¶;jk92zel;mgd7n;t8i3l3lk
I didn‚Äôt choose it it chooses me. Studied Applied Mathematics I wanted to get into Data Science but got multiple offers as SWE and none in Data. I gotta pay the bills and covid happened and now the economy it‚Äôs better to do this now than switching and starting over.;jk8yrkq;k37cqst5;t8i3l3lk
Both my parents were programmers.  I resisted for my first year of college but then I took a CS class and I had an inborn interest and natural ability to do it so I switch my major to CS.  My son inherited the same but does not program.;jk8wrf2;q40ylesy;t8i3l3lk
I was tired of sharing my ‚Äúmillion dollar‚Äù ideas with my programmer friends thinking they were going to steal my ideas. (Funny to look back on) but one day I decided I‚Äôd just learn to build them myself.Well. My million dollar ideas never turned into anything. But I ended up getting a job that pays me at least 5x more than I ever made before starting to code.And I can build my own ideas without needing anybody else for anything. It was an unexpected path. But one I am happy as hell I went down.;jk90y3a;20sh5yt8;t8i3l3lk
I was sick of using Ed tech platforms that gave users garbage data huge blind spots and low accessibility as a teacher and for users. I‚Äôm almost done with my AS in CS.;jk911h2;hqviu;t8i3l3lk
"I didn't want to get into it but I stayed for the money.I learned programming just to make a few things for myself and somehow lucked into a job for it. After a couple years I decided it wasn't what I wanted to do so I went to school for EE.I kept getting stuck doing mostly software at my ""EE"" internships and when it came time to graduate all my good offers were in software. So here I am.That said over the years I've started liking software more but if I could get paid the same amount for EE I'd be gone.";jk8xb44;b7id4g6;t8i3l3lk
Going into my senior year with incomplete transcripts‚Ä¶My options were military or Devry.Devry would take me without transcripts.

"It got me out of class once.I was in high school and learning how to calculate matrices. My math teacher gave us stories about how he would program in binary. I found a Visual Basic book in a book store that intrigued me. I spent the weekend building a simple 4x4 matrix calculator. Accept input from 8 edit boxes and do calculations. UI had a clear button.I was so excited I went early to the class to show the teacher and ask if I could use my simple program on the test. I showed him the code and what it did because I didn't want to get caught cheating. ""Can I use this on the test."" I asked.""You coded this?"" He paused ""you don't need to take the test  you have proven that you understand how to calculate matrices you are excused from today's class""I have been coding ever since.";jka19yc;68hxln2k;t8i3l3lk

My dad was a CS major and a DB guy when I was a kid so I already had a leg up technology wise. I got really into web design when I was in middle school and had a whole community of girls like me.  we basically taught each other how to program to make our websites better. I thought I'd do websites my whole life. I don't care for front-end now :D very different from in the 90s. I've done soap services backend development  mobile development  workflows  rest services machine learning  devops and now I'm not sure what I'm doing.  Reliability something something. All fun.;jk91jmm;37u1n;t8i3l3lk

I told my dad that I‚Äôd be a software engineer when I was a kid. However he didn‚Äôt like my idea. I loved computers but he had me get the phone communications degree since he studied the same thing. I worked for him until I decided to get into IT.First I was a QA. Then I got interested in coding and loved it instantly. I decided that I really wanted to be a software engineer rather than click the shit around and report bugs. Last year I joined my current software company where I switched to frontend development.;jk97bgq;tju18311;t8i3l3lk
I was working in phone tech support and enjoyed the challenge of solving technical puzzles. Also I wanted more money.;jk8yyc3;f61lkcz;t8i3l3lk
I actually didn't want to become a programmer I hated all the programming courses in university. I wanted to be an electrical engineer and work on industrial automation systems. Couldn't find a job in that ended up working as a battery technician and then did data analysis and realized I actually really love problem solving.This eventually led me down more and more data work and now I'm a data engineer/backend developer and I love it. Programming lets you do all the problem solving of engineering without the constant constraints of building something waiting for a shipment and then testing it to find something wrong.Debuggers are so well built that you can really get into the details of how programs are running at any given moment. It allows programming to give you the gratification of solving problems much sooner than in classical engineering.;jk900yd;5p10k8xk;t8i3l3lk

Figuring out what works how it works how to approach the problem etc- i still like math. I miss doing math proofs for my homework.

Working with computers is the only thing that‚Äôs kept my interest over the years. I actually went into IT initially but realized if I wanted a degree it made more sense to do CS. Obv the money doesn‚Äôt hurt but that aspect is more about stability than anything else.

"I don't yet work as a programmer but I had a rather... clumsy path into that desire.I wanted to be an artist. Then an animator. Then a blogger. Then a YouTuber. Then a web designer. Then a field technician.I landed on programmer because of two factors: 1) I pursued a degree in IT Management and realized I want nothing to do with business or management and 2) my previous job had a training program for employees interested in software engineering with no experience required. This led to me studying Java for their technical assessment. I already knew HTML CSS and a small amount of JavaScript so I wasn't wholly unfamiliar with programming. The program was delayed and since I left my job I was no longer eligible. But I found I couldn't easily return to JavaScript because I wanted to continue learning Java and I went back and forth for a period of time.I signed up for a boot camp for front-end web development since I like that side more (and I'm currently doing that boot camp). I can't describe the exact ""ah-ha"" moment because I don't know when it happened. The simplest way to explain is I became involved with communities tutorials projects and I'm now pre-enrolled in college and will start in September after the boot camp.Thinking back on all of it it's not that surprising because I wanted to pursue computer science as a teenager but I was horrendous at math and science and was interested specifically in programming. In my teenage mind it was a degree for geniuses not someone who couldn't solve a basic fraction problem in her head. It also satisfies my odd love of puzzles and blocks which I've had since I was a child. Seriously best way to keep my toddler self occupied was to dump a pile of blocks in front of me and walk away.**TL; DR** - I changed my mind a dozen times and landed on programmer.";jk97027;5cfeiz0p;t8i3l3lk
"Note: Officially became a software developer around 31. I did other stuff in my 20s before becoming a technical writer and then a developer (after I worked with developers every day and realized I could do the work).1. Money. My entry level salary was higher than my experienced Tech Writer salary and what I make now would have taken a lot longer to get to that way.2. A more ""defineable"" career path. Before I was always some euphemistic job title which was hard to figure out what to apply for before. Like I was a ""Policy Analyst"" but also a ""Administrative Assistant"" who did a lot of program-related work and not just a front desk receptionist. But I was also that. It meant lots of BS jobs that were usually some sort of sales (but not called Sales because the product sucked or was shady so actual salesmen wouldn't bother). Now I can just type ""software developer"" and I don't have to read between the lines on the job requirements to figure out if they really want me to be doing what I'm supposed to be. Related is salary negotiation. I have a much better idea of what I'm worth and can simply state what I expect in terms of salary and I don't have to read tea leaves on whether a job is wildly over or underpaid.3. Generally better to just work a normal schedule that's flexible that you can't get with a ton of other positions. Especially since it's expected that sometimes you just get the work done and it's not based on hours per se.4. I do like the work it's neat to build something and see it work even if it's virtual on the computer compared to something physical like an engine. It's engaging to come up with solutions and see them go through. Not quite the same as seeing my favorite band in concert but it's still ""fun"" in its own way. I like that I get paid to be curious and a problem solver.";jk97amy;h5sml;t8i3l3lk

I got to it a bit indirectly. It started when my neighbor got a computer and then later I got too but without internet in those times. I liked to play with it and learn to use it.Later when I got internet I started to wrote a blog. I played with customisation of HTML and CSS. It was quite fun. I decided to take programming course in the last year of high school and I was quite good at it.Despite all of that I chose applied mathematics for my university major. Only to change it to CS after the first 2 weeks of semester üòÖ I lived with CS students in the dorm and I really liked what they were doing. I wasn't that great at applied math and it seemed boring compared to CS.Since then I enjoy IT and mostly the creativity of programming of finding solutions to problems. Even system architecture seems fun it's like a Lego.I never regretted I switched majors.;jk9dco5;13ngx0;t8i3l3lk
I‚Äôve used computers since I was a kid maybe not as a programmer necessarily but internet was a big part of my youth because I wasn‚Äôt doing so well socially irl - in hindsight because my home life wasn‚Äôt great (it wasn‚Äôt horrific but it wasn‚Äôt good). So I picked up some basic scripting around middle school / high school. Then I spent a long time not programming but got back into it around the time Raspberry Pi got released - which was insane to me because when I was a kid a computer was supposed to be expensive. Then I tried to get into medicine but failed which in hindsight was really fortunate because I‚Äôm not well suited for that sort of work. At that point my only marketable skill was programming and so I got back into it. It‚Äôs been 6 years now since I started doing computer work (BI dev then data engineer and now I‚Äôm a SRE). It‚Äôs pretty crazy how things have gone in life and actually I‚Äôm pretty good at coding (like I can do LeetCode hards from time to time) so I guess it ended up being a good fit.;jk9dl29;3k09s5vn;t8i3l3lk

"I enjoyed solving problems with code because the of the basically instant feedback of compile and run.  I would have likely enjoyed being an EE or ME as well but the turn around time for actually using the thing you designed is on the scale of months and years.I also got exposure to computers and ""programming"" early in life which probably helped.   I remember in 3rd grade to 8th grade we had a weekly ""computer course"" where we learned BASIC.  A lot of it was spoon fed to us but it was still fun to write code and they see it work.  This was back in the late 80's and early 90's when I was in elementary and middle school. Surprisingly there was no coding courses when I was in my high school from 94-98.  The only course was really ""keyboarding"" which was just learning how to type on a keyboard.  This was a required high school course as well.I created tons of dumb webpages on GeoCities in my free time in high school. It was easy to just look at the source HTML / CSS for a website and see how they did things.  So I learned lots of things that way.Interesting enough after college I went a more embedded applications route with C and C++ and not creating webpages.  Money never entered in to my mind when choosing to be a CS major and it was the same for the people graduate college with that I still talk to today.  It was just a happy coincidence that you had the potential to make lots of money which I actually don't. Since I'm more driven by the work and projects then money I don't really do things that maximize money.  I think Leetcode is generally fine but the whole gamification of it where you have to solve X problem in 20 minutes to get a top paying job is were I loose interest.  I'm not a competitive person so things like competitive programming and hackathons never interested me all that much. Give me hours where I can write code compile test and iterate and I'm confident I can solve most Leetcode but that's not the game at top tech companies and that's fine. I guess at some level the journey of discovery is a big thing I find fun.  That is to say the whole write code compile test and iterate is what I enjoy.   I find seeing how my code didn't work they way I expected and finding a way to correct it fun.  I may not be fast at it compared to smart people here for money but I'm going to consistently get things done.  I generally don't need lots of hand holding and I can get a new tool play with it for a bit and learn how to do things fairly well.  I don't generally need somebody to show me how to use a tool. I can read the man page or look at help options and get what I need done.I'm rambling now so I'm going to stop typing lol.";jk9ebfr;fb1k3;t8i3l3lk

Went teaching English abroad for a few more years and then back to admin jobs.I got really depressed with working 9-5 each day and not making enough money to save for my future and not feeling like I had accomplished anything in life.  There was definitely a feeling of would I call it snobbishness? in wanting to tell people not job title was anything else apart from ""an admin"" a customer service rep"" etc.So I started coding to get into game dev.  I then started learning to build websites.  Took some online courses went back to college and eventually landed my role as a web dev.  Earning a decent amount of money now to provide for my kids and save a tiny bit towards my future.";jk9lles;13wfvl;t8i3l3lk
Being a designer and a teacher sucked ass and I wanted to learn coding anyways but was afraid of maths before I understood I don't need to be a genius at it unless I code for games and graphics shenanigans.Also I can finally use Linux and not have everyone around me thinking I'm weird for it.;jk9ls6r;cla00j0w;t8i3l3lk
I loved the internet as long as I could remember. In highschool I was in a math class and a teacher popped in and advertised to sign up for programming next year then left as suddenly as he came. in a way that man ended up deciding my college and early career up until now lol.so I signed up and started programming @ 17 my junior year of hs. I was god awful and cheated fought begged whatever to pass that class. I signed up for the 2nd class for next year.Senior year I did try to learn during the year but without a teacher it was limited. I got a 1 on the AP exam lol and then used that as fuel to self-study programming that summer and learned probably more than I did in 2 years in school.from there I started to really like programming - I made it my life my first two years of college. I could do the coursework with ease but still struggled in math or other engineering courses and then I used all my freetime to keep getting better at coding. My biggest mistake was sacrificing health and my social life to chase this goal because I was chasing a pretty unsustainable goal of wanting to code/study 8-10 hours a day but I could only do like 1-3 hours a day tops. Spent the rest of the day feeling guilty I'm not doing enough.This did pay off with an internship my 2nd year in college summer and it was hard work with a pretty rough commute but I loved it. I was rewarded with a return offer and at that point I knew I was going to become a programmer.I became one because I thought I was going to really like it and the money was pretty great. fast forward a few years I struggle to tolerate it just 1 year in but the money is as advertised and I don't see myself doing anything better atm.;jk9m3ls;lfrjho2k;t8i3l3lk
I've always loved gaming and I found myself wanting to make my own. So I took a few courses and found out that I loved programming.There is just something very addictive and satisfying about creating something or fixing something with code I was sucked in almost immediately.;jk9m5kd;3wlsgcbd;t8i3l3lk
Snow Crash's protagonist seemed really cool and I thought the idea of being so familiar with computers you could basically do anything very attractive.;jk9md1z;edffv;t8i3l3lk
Man I remember I first took a programming class in middle school and I did fine. Didn‚Äôt think anything of it. It was easy. No idea it could be a job though.I chose computer science as a major thinking it was more along the lines of IT. That‚Äôs how ignorant I was. When my IT internship left me stuck with nothing to do I talked to a different manager and started doing development with python. I kind of fell into it but sticking it out I‚Äôm only now just barely getting decent. This industry and my fellow programmers can be barbaric. But I‚Äôm grateful I landed something I‚Äôm working and heck the recruiters are starting to answer again.There is no why I wanted to just why I did.;jk9mghe;906sdcml;t8i3l3lk

I always loved tech right from my childhood. Although I didn't code in my childhood I'd still spend a lot of time on the computer browsing various websites and developed a good understanding on how to use a computer. I was introduced to the world of programming in my school (I was 16 back then). Right from day 1 everything clicked to me clearly and I'd almost always come with the right answers myself for any doubt I had. I decided I'll just code for a living and I am lucky that this field turned out to be one of the best careers you could choose.;jk9ncmf;6wwuhxxw;t8i3l3lk
"Always enjoyed video games and computers.  Working in the trades sucked and I heard the ""learn to code"" sentiment / challenge out there in the world at the time.  Took up the challenge (enjoyed logic / philosophy in college and hated my job) and very much enjoyed it right out of the gate.  Taught myself into employment.";jk9nkjr;ibk82e8w;t8i3l3lk

Was really intrigued by the breadth of problems that can be solved with programming. I used to view it purely as a building block for applications and websites. Once I took my college CS courses I realized it‚Äôs much more abstract than that. There‚Äôs always going to be more work in the field and the opportunity to be part of bringing something exciting to life.;jk9oj50;35xkd5sv;t8i3l3lk

I was always good with computers quickly became the family ‚ÄúIT‚Äù guy as computers and the internet was on the rise. Was always obsessed with Apple and iOS. I was watching a tv show called Revolution where the world loses a electricity one of the characters used to work at google. In flashback scenes he‚Äôs in a limo with his wife mind you he‚Äôs fat and she‚Äôs beautiful and mentions something about using the company jet to go to one of their houses plural. He was a software engineer. I quickly googled software engineer and found what i wanted to do at age 12. 12 years later I love my job i love coding and problem solving ofc i probably won‚Äôt be like the guy on tv taking jets to multiple houses but damn I feel pretty close to it.

"I grew up playing with a ZX81 - actually before my dad got me that my best mate at school and I would spend hours typing in programs into the display computers in WHSmiths and the staff there would mostly let us because they showed off what the computers could do. It was kinda fun & absorbing. I went from a ZX81 to an Amstrad CPC6128 and tried to get an A-level in Computer Studies. I actually flunked that - I have autism & ADHD and I don't do well with unspecified tasks like ""Write a computer program"". Choice paralysis fucks me up and most of the marks depended on this project. I would have been fine with an exam asking things like ""Which sorting algorithm is best for this kind of dataset and why?"" or ""Explain the difference between random access and indexed sequential files and say which might be best in what situation"". Anyway I went & did a job as a desktop publishing operator at the local newspaper then lost that & ended up on the dole. From that I got put onto an Employment Training programme for a tenner extra dole each week where we learned COBOL and MS-BASIC failed to get a job from that went & got A-levels in English and French did a degree in French ended up on a project creating a website for the local theatre. Graduated got a temp job as an admin assistant ended up designing a database system for project documentation in BG Transco's VJV with Sema Group then got taken on as a graduate recruit by Capgemini who were recruiting for Y2K. I was on a few legacy financial projects doing app support and extensions/enhancements & debugging. I don't think there was really a point at which I decided ""This is what I want to do with my life"". Mostly it's just what I could do and for the most part it hasn't bored me stupid though I keep getting funnelled into app support and into more and more dumbed down roles till I fuck off and get a better job with another employer. What I love doing: designing and building systems to a decent spec taking a bottom up approach analysing a business' forms & existing data & business processes and matching that up with a top-down approach from interviewing employees to get requirements capture & use cases. What I hate: being the monkey who presses a button to build/deliver the software every week. Guess what I'm doing now. :-/I am \*so\* depressed.";jk9qfxg;3xvjp;t8i3l3lk

I grew up in a low income family. From a young age they pushed that I study math & sciences to assure I‚Äôd have a stable& well paying career. I was more artsy when I was young but I also knew I didn‚Äôt want to be poor when I got older so I understood their push to get me into STEM.One day during my sophomore year of high school we had a career day and my math teach brought her sister in to give a presentation about being a programmer. That was the first time the career path caught my eye.About a year later my friends and I have a movie night. I bought ‚ÄúFrozen‚Äù for that night and in the special features they had a bit on Disney ‚ÄúImagineers‚Äù. That‚Äôs when I realized programming/tech can apply to just about anywhere. So it became my goal to be a developer for Disney Animation studios.That shit never happened for me but I did go into CS and have since had a pretty solid career since.;jk9rkme;u57sa;t8i3l3lk

I wanted to be able to offer technical solutions to regular folks who say: needed a website or application for their small business.  More or less the ability to help businesses with missions I believe in and to help build my community;jk9u1tm;lqnj1bch;t8i3l3lk
Back in my freshman year I ran a blog for fun. There was another blogger who always had a nice website design so I was trying to learn how they did it by inspecting elements. I remember my biggest issue was not knowing technical terms thus not being able to google properly. However after some time I improved and I ended up creating free templates that got a few thousands of downloads. So when it was time to go to college this wasn‚Äôt an out of nowhere decision.I am in my mid 20s now.;jk9u7ph;6iw04fcr;t8i3l3lk

I went into college pursuing CS. I was damn good at it but got curb stomped by Calculus and other additional academia bs. Upon realizing I coasted through C++ courses without ever having been taught even basic networking I quit.I wound up switching over to public policy only to learn quickly that unless you have magnificent connections within that industry its a professional dead end.I went into humanitarian work and brought on an intern to handle accounting for a disaster response. He spent the whole disaster trying to get into a coworker‚Äôs pants and blamed me for him not doing anything.At the end of the hurricane relief effort none of the paper work was done and he pointed his finger at me as the reason why. I tapped my finger on the table thinking for a bit and finally said: ‚ÄúNot only will I make sure you never participate in another disaster response but I am also going to automate your job so I never have to staff it again.‚Äù :PThe programming sector started being like: ‚ÄúOh! You‚Äôre actually better than most grads we interview.‚ÄùMe: ‚Äú‚Ä¶uh huh.‚Äù Then I sold da f-k out. XDWhile I got back in via Python a job forced me a learn Rust and Javascript which pretty much ‚Äòsealed the deal‚Äô skill-wise.;jk9xrnd;jqnf5;t8i3l3lk

Make a video game and then I got to college and was like ‚ÄúI want to be a linguist.‚Äù  8 years later and 50k and student loan debt drop out I got a job in a  call center with no real direction.  Left the call center for a different job at the same company.  Someone needed somethingn automated in vba‚Ä¶. Did that and had fun.   Did more shit had more fun but it‚Äôs not a a a game dev.

Didn‚Äôt like my economics major. Programming looked sick although I‚Äôd never done it before. Turned out to be a blast and I was good enough at it to be successful. Can‚Äôt believe I get paid to do it honestly.During college I did personal side projects for fun. Since graduating I‚Äôve kind of lost the motivation to do that. Work is tough. I work at a scientific company with some brilliant people I work as hard as I can to keep up. At the end of the day I need to unwind off the computer. AI replacing me is my biggest career fear. The models of today couldn‚Äôt replace me not even close. But it‚Äôs advancing so fast who the hell knows where it‚Äôll be in 10 years and I‚Äôll still be 25 years from retiring. That‚Äôs why I max out all my retirement options now.;jka1xiz;116en8;t8i3l3lk
I have done it since I left school. However I quit late last year and I‚Äôm changing career. Programming is well paid but it most definitely comes at a cost.

An insurance company. Lmao if you think im gonna go and do crunch and shit. I love my well paid 35hours.

I started coding for funsies freshman year of high school back in 99 with some techie friends. Always loved computers. Had to pick a major freshman year of school and I had done some basic pascal and C programming classes in high school so I figured I'd just keep going. Programming kinds just ended up being the tip of the iceberg for that major but everything I studied beyond the intro programming year ended up being more and more interesting. Didn't really know what I wanted to do with it but went to one interview halfway through my senior year and got the job so i was like I guess I'll be a programmer. 15 years ago rest is history. One of the chillest professions out there IMO. You tend to work with pretty relaxes smart folks people work at problems not necessarily even that super hard usually just consistently until you get stuff done...or you might occasionally have a crazy deadline.  Disregard most things I said above if you like work for amazon.;jka7pqy;8hgfhhd0;t8i3l3lk

"When I was young I loved programming games with game maker. When I got to high school I figured that it wasn't worth getting a degree in computer science because that math was impossible (I always hated math with a burning passion). I still did small side jobs with htmlcss and WordPress while in college. Eventually got into tech support and asked one of my coworkers what she did. She showed me some pretty rudimentary looking forms that she created. I was thought to myself ""you get paid to make  _that_ ?"" It wasn't pretty and i knew that if she could get paid to do that so could i. so I figured I'll get into the programming professionally. Taught myself and I'm pissed that there's not really much math to it (generally speaking). I could have had 9 years experiance by now instead of 1! Oh well live and learn.";jka81jn;9tfed;t8i3l3lk

The glass ceiling and lack of autonomy were not for me and it kept feeling like I settled so I withdrew after mulling it over and went back for a CS degree.

"I stumbled into programming from a now defunct website try2hack.nl it was a hacking challenge website and that sounded cool at the time. I needed help past level 1 ofcourse because I didn't know anything. They had a help chat on some irc server. Don't remember which one but it wasn't freenode I remember that. There was an IRC bot. I thought that was cool. A piece of software connecting to the server pretending to be a user. I started making IRC bots. never finished the hacking challenge. Fell in love with programming. Making an IRC bot is still my go to self assignment for learning a new language. To me programming is math and data structures and also a little bit art.&#x200B;Amendment: The difficulty of making an irc bot in C++ is what lead me to get a CS degree. For internetwork protocol class I made prototype IRC server and client (ncurses console UI) It could only create a room privmsg the room or person.

I went to college and majored in InfoSec with minors in networking and programming. I grew up playing a lot of video games and have always had a high interest in computers - taking them apart building them making them run faster etc.  When I was younger I played a lot of Halo 2 and was a big part of the modding community and I would contribute to different projects with C# modules. Looking back I probably didn't help much but it was fun and I thought it was kinda cool.     I fell into my role it wasn't something I initially went after. I got into banking as a way to have consistent working hours and weekends off. I originally applied to work in accounting but wasn't selected for the role but did get selected for an opening in IT because of my background and that eventually led to me working as a programmer.    I didn't always want to be a programmer and I'm still not sure if that's what I want. I just know that I like to solve problems and make things more efficient so programming has felt really natural to me.;jkajovw;4mnrkro2;t8i3l3lk

I wanted to join the Air Force. My grandfather joined it the day after it was formed and he gave me flying lessons. I was going to graduate high school and be a pilot already and sign up. However they wouldn't even consider me because I'm gay so I became the first guy in my family in 3 generations not to join the military. Then I wanted to be an airline pilot but I found out that to get a job with airlines as a pilot you had to be a former air force pilot so once again not an option.My next choice was to be a computer programmer. My father was a programmer and I'd literally had my first programming lesson on his knee with punch cards and the mainframe at the age of 2. It was a good stable job that paid well.

When I was a child I had a bad (good) habit of disassembling _everything_ I could touch usually electronic in nature. Cameras toasters not microwaves dvd and VHS players. One day many years later I even learned how to put these things back together again. Shortly thereafter: the family computer.It was 'what was available'. it was mediocre even for the day but not cheap no no no. I was not permitted to disassemble it (so I made sure not to get caught!).It became apparent to my parents that I was the only individual in the family of four and even within our extended family who understood what this machine was how it operated and most importantly how to fix it. And so at barely 14 years old my unpaid internship began as the family 'computer literate person'.Then I took programming courses in high school. Visual basic and java. I actually found it pretty intuitive after the first few lessons. By the 3rd level programming course I was spending twenty percent of the class time doing my own work and the remainder tutoring others or doing fuck all. Math came very naturally to me and in particular calculus. My brain when programming _feels_ very similar to my brain when doing calc. In university my dad pressured me into a Business degree but I knew where my heart was. I took programming options the first two years and did quite well. My management courses and finance courses were admittedly neglected. So I had a chat with the head of the CS department and my dad and ultimately sent a letter to the dean pointing out the stark contrast in my grades between CS and !CS courses and switched to a CS degree.I've been working in the software development industry for a while. Working Effectively with Legacy Code is my Bible. I'm considering a switch to DevOps.;jkarqlb;b6yycsa1;t8i3l3lk

"So I always was interested in computers and I spent pretty much my entire childhood in front of my computer always playing games installing mods messing with emulators etc. and I was aware of programming but had no clue where to start.I was really into Minecraft back then (circa 2011/2012) and I wanted to make a Bukkit plugin so I started learning a bit of java. I never actually followed through with it though I got to the ""hello world"" stage and then when it started getting into data types arithmetic and control flow I kind of lost interest and quit learning. I was a bit young though and I just wasn't ready yet nor did I have a project in mind that I was passionate about enough to overcome the learning curve.FFW a couple of years I was in middle school but they had a program where middle school students could go to the local high school and take math classes that were a year ahead if they had good standardized testing scores. I had this teacher who was really awesome and she gave us an assignment to draw some shapes to the screen by writing some code. I'm not sure if it was in Python or something else but in that moment something clicked for me.When I got to high school I took CS classes with that teacher every year and I actually formed a really good relationship with her and we're still in contact to this day. In my freshman year I was in a class that taught Java and I quickly learned the entire year's worth of content in about 2 weeks (it was a very easy class) which meant I ended up with a LOT of free time in class and an excellent teacher who allowed me to work on personal projects and would help me out with things.I started learning C++ in that class; I downloaded Code::Blocks onto the computer and began learning C++ and I would show my programs to my teacher and have her give me suggestions to improve or we would just talk about programming in general.I also would spend hours writing C++ code when I got home after school it became a hobby for me. I made lots of projects that were just CLI programs; I made a game inspired by cookie clicker where as time advanced you could gain more money and buy items to increase your revenue further until you had a certain amount of money at which point you won the game. Very simple not really a challenging game either (just time consuming) but seeing my changes appear on screen was really cool to me and just the fact that it was something that *i made from scratch*.From there I branched out and began learning other things. I picked up the SFML library for C++ and started recreating some old Atari 2600 games; Breakout Snake Pong etc. and developing those games improved my problem solving abilities taught me about basic data structures and algorithms and I improved at programming a lot. Eventually I went on to develop a top down RPG game in SFML which even though I never completed or fleshed out the story was still a technical achievement for me at the time and was my magnum opus in high school.Prior to learning to program I did not know what I wanted to do with my life. I was considering getting a job in healthcare because of decent pay and job security; however I (like many other people who are majoring in CS) am not the best in social settings and healthcare would have been an awful career path for me where I would have hated my life. So as I delved deeper into programming I knew what I wanted to do.I began attending my state university for computer science. At first my grades were awful because I didn't have the time management or study skills necessary for university coursework; however my prior knowledge in CS totally carried me and kept me from flunking out; I was always able to get A's in all of my CS classes because I already knew all of the content and I was even able to get credit-by-examination for a few CS classes which contributed to padding my GPA.Now I'm quite late in my university career and my grades have had a strong upward trend in general. I have been working very hard to bring my GPA up and by the time I graduate it will likely be close to 3.7. My goals are not monetary I just really love computer science and have found my passion in life. Not only the software engineering aspect but also the theoretical computer science side of things; I took a few classes in discrete mathematics and automata theory and I excelled in those.At this point I'm thinking I will likely go for my PHD after I finish undergraduate studies and I have began setting myself up for that. I would love to have the opportunity to become an expert in the field do research and follow my passion. I would also love to teach other people Computer Science so perhaps I will become a CS professor in the future. My high school teacher changed the course of my entire life and if I could do that for someone else even just one person my bukkit list would be complete.";jkbi4bd;lluviw4g;t8i3l3lk
My happiest times was behind a computer. Playing video games. Habbo hotel. Dungeon keeper. Isketch.com . I would blast 2000s music and just be online. Trying to make websites and hosting them for free on .tk domains At some point the idea of ‚Äúpower‚Äù came up. A friend of mine taught me the idea of a hacker and script kiddie. He met some older guy online(we are 13 at the time) and the older guy did some sort of flood attack(?) where I couldn‚Äôt use my browser‚Ä¶ all I saw was my modem lights flashing really fast.. to this day no one can explain what happened to me or even propose any theories..Apparently you could get someone‚Äôs IP address over MSN by sending them a file which creates a direct connection to them over some port so my friend got my IP by sending me an MP3 and gave it to the older guy. Suddenly some random person adds me online on MSN and my internet doesn‚Äôt work! All I can do is talk to this hacker over MSN.I had to tell my dad and I got in trouble. All the older guy wanted me to do was admit I was a ‚Äúscript kiddie‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt want to.I can‚Äôt remember the whole story but it was a couple of days of him trying to demean me and get me to admit I don‚Äôt know anything and me trying to pretend like I knew things. I would say things like I know 10x more than you think I know!! And he would say ‚Äú10 X 0 is still 0‚ÄùThen my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù admitted to the whole thing. Told me him and the older guy are laughing at me behind my back. At some point the older guy got bored or I finally said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a script kiddie‚Äù I think the idea of memory editing came up shortly after using memory hacker and artmoney to edit memory and try to get cool things to happen in video games but also not knowing what ‚Äúclientside‚Äù meant trying to chat with other people online interested in ‚Äúhacking‚Äù.The computer was always my escape.

Honestly? It happened by pure accident. I never saw myself as an engineer for a couple of reasons. I I unknowingly had ADHD and dyslexia which made school learning and focusing impossible. I wanted to learn but it felt impossible. This also made college pretty difficult too I dropped out 3 times at 2 different schools when going for some non engineering degrees. I never felt like I would be smart enough to comprehend what software engineers do so I never really cared to seek it out. **Now the story of how I stumbled upon being an engineer:**I went to college for my 3rd attempt hated what I was studying and financially was broker than broke. No Finacial support from family and was also dealing with some major family issues at the time. Essentially I dropped out and got myself a job at some call center for a software company doing tech support. I didn‚Äôt think much of it. I was pretty handy with tech on the surface level. Well turns out I was pretty handy with tech. Within two years at this company I moved up to different roles VOC analyst support engineer and landing eventually in a QA/automation engineer role. I had no programming background no idea about anything with software engineering or development. But I was open to learning all that I could. Stayed at that company for 3 more years as a SDET leading deploys doing automation work across shared frameworks becoming a SME in various areas for my team. It gave me the opportunity inspiration and financial ability to  make going back to school to complete my undergrad possible again. I‚Äôm now in the last year of my software engineering degree and I am so happy that life worked in such a way allowing me to find this career path. I now can‚Äôt see myself doing anything else. :);jkbn9mz;2nnqxlxe;t8i3l3lk
I'm lazy and would rather automate what I can.;jkbo5vx;ukrc4;t8i3l3lk
I got a degree in Math from University. Didn't know (or really care) what I wanted my career to be so I just applied to Actuarial Finance and Software jobs and told myself whichever one I got into first would be my career;jkbp1gg;106xwc;t8i3l3lk
I wanted to work in space exploration and was trying to be an electrical engineer. Then I accidentally became a software engineer enjoyed it and just kept moving forward.You?;jkbpeb0;fgi9e;t8i3l3lk
I was approaching college enrollment unsure if that to study and my dad read an article in Forbes that computer programmers were in need around the country (2012). I was always good with computers and did compsci on a whim and stuck with it;jkbplxx;36uo3hb3;t8i3l3lk
I never wanted to be hands-on with the general public again (customer service hospitality etc);jkbq14o;1740r5;t8i3l3lk
Was a math major and the CS prof said I should switch to CS. The local campus had a lot more online CS courses available than math courses and I hate driving so I just ended up switching since I already had enough math courses done to fulfill the requirements for CS.;jkbr0yl;21gbhfme;t8i3l3lk
For all those who got into it for the money I can‚Äôt help but remember people going from CS into nursing after the dot com bust.  The salaries crashed a lot back then.;jkbrhqq;zi5eq1w;t8i3l3lk
I was a math guy but switched career paths in college and stumbled upon CS and added it to my degree. Then I went to grad school for math.After college I didn't work in CS but I got burned out in my field and heard of an entry level programming job applied got it and it has been upward ever since.Why did I want it? I really enjoyed the classes I took in college and felt like I was good at it. Data structures and algorithms came naturally and I loved reading white papers and RFCs and stuff.;jkbrncj;1otjb5x;t8i3l3lk
I originally wanted to do UX design- took a few classes in community college that included some basic programming classes and ended up liking the programming classes more. Also realized it seems like there are more backend dev jobs out there. Found an internship and now I‚Äôm mostly backend dev but getting the opportunity to learn more frontend so mebbe soon I‚Äôll get to claim full stack :);jkbssuk;q33cr;t8i3l3lk
just kind of ended up being a CS major and now I‚Äôm finishing my junior year of my bachelors! I always liked math in high school but never coded before university but took a class my freshman year and it was pretty interesting but I didn‚Äôt think about it much. I tried a bunch of different major classes and realized I actually liked coding the most out of all of them and stuck with it since then. I never thought this would be my major and people are often surprised at me being a cs major haha. I really like it though. I‚Äôm starting my first programming job next year!;jkbt5ys;9j705vm1;t8i3l3lk

"I studied Civil Engineering and was part of a [model] bridge design competition which involved a lot of guess & check on design tweaks. Each minor tweak was several pages of computations to compute the resulting weight and deflection (cost constraints of the competition). I started in excel writing crazy formulas and using ""solver"" but reached some limits on what that could do so I stumbled my way into VBA. When I graduated I went to work on logistics and found a lot of part planning (PFEPs) that could be improved with VBA and taught myself MS Access from there I started transitioning into python to get out of the Microsoft specific ecosystem which also allowed me to pivot into a finance domain.My big driver side from career advancement had always been striving to streamline my workflow and remove menial work.After I learned python my career accelerated and I became more of a polyglot I stayed in the finance domain but transitioned from an analyst to the backend then to full stack then to data and eventually to an em role. My primary driver is still the same; I like streaming processes and automating things people don't like doing / non-value-add work - the only thing that's changed is the scope.";jkbv8sa;1v1emkr;t8i3l3lk

I used to make mobile websites and write html on my notebook and then do it on mobile phone since I didn't have a computer back then it was like 2006 or so. After I got computer went to gaming since I didn't know how to program and use Google was more interested in upgrading pc by my self. Later on went for computer science college degree tried programming for internship but didn't put a lot of effort into that and got stuck as a quality assurance guy for 4 years got pissed off and just wanted to sit and write code so here I am!;jkbzijo;2tyg20mf;t8i3l3lk

Kinda always liked PC stuff and video games and started randomly looking at the code of websites and found it interesting. Started copy/pasting stuff from various pages to piece together something of my own and found it fun. Eventually we ended up having some guy give free Pascal lessons at school so I gave it a try and enjoyed it as well so I ended up deciding to go for CS / PC stuff;jkc3rvp;zsh37;t8i3l3lk
I like legos engines etc. Taking things apart figuring out what makes them tick and putting them back together. Tinkering. Code is just digital legos. Once you understand the basic building blocks you can follow the instructions and build the set or you can grow into a master builder and start combining sets coming up with new ways to use old pieces etc. With code you can do something basic like build a web form‚Ä¶or you can do something incredibly complex like enterprise software. You can work solo on a small or medium project or as a team of hundreds to build a monument to creativity (in most cases kinda sorta not really creatively solving a problem that makes you money in a ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù fashion). Unfortunately lots of the time the time and flexibility to be perfect or creative simply isn‚Äôt there at large companies. Which is why people quit for greener pastures despite leaving massive paychecks on the table and find themselves suddenly happy enjoying coding again on their own time at their own pace for their own passion.;jkc4x8m;h0z6u;t8i3l3lk

"First time I coded something was when I was around 10 years old. My father got me a Visual Basic CD and I managed to create a hello world executable just by reading the documentation (didn't have internet at the time). Unfortunately I didn't pursue this career until many years later out of pure necessity (my STEM degree wasn't landing me any jobs) I said fuck it and pivoted into Data Science. Best decision I've ever had: lots of fun infinite learning paths to pursue high salary and WFH.It's funny I didn't do a CS degree because I thought the market was oversaturated. Now I read the same argument again and again and I laugh. It has been ""oversaturated"" for the last 20 years if we believe these claims and nevertheless it's one of the most well paid careers you can pursue.";jkc8tyo;ezqgf;t8i3l3lk
I recall this TED talk on career adviceShould you follow your passion?The money?Or your skills?Well I'm reasonably passionate about comp sci especially algo stuff. The money is certainly there and I'm also quite good at it.So it's sort of a no brainer;jkcamnx;hl1mr;t8i3l3lk
Best paying thing I was at least a bit interested in;jkcaxyu;6zgt4udm;t8i3l3lk
I have social anxiety and that made me drawn to computers as a child because computers are not human. So that turned into games tinkering hacking programming -> then high school that was focused on computers and electronics then CS uni. Also I thought there were going to be job security.;jkcby4u;ea8kj;t8i3l3lk
I was always very right-brained and good at humanities and I wanted to try my hand at more left-brained disciplines like math and CS to see how well I‚Äôd do;jkcefst;ujl3h6p7;t8i3l3lk
I‚Äôve always been into tech since when I was 4/5 years old I already had cellphones in my hand. As I became a teenager I started tinkering with Android phones custom ROM‚Äôs etc. Just generally interested in anything tech related really. That translated into a CS degree and a development job afterwards and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the way things turned out tbh.;jkcfc6v;a11mu7bf;t8i3l3lk
"I was really curious how computers and the Internet worked when I was around 10 years old. My father used to help me with building my own website and I really loved it. When high school came by it unturned that I can understand chemistry really well so from then on I was being pushed into a chemist career by family by teachers friends etc. When I mentioned that programming and computers are the topic that interests me I got all kind of lectures how it's not gonna be a thing when I will be an adult. So I ended up doing a BSc in chemical engineering with publications conferences and other stuff like that. I felt empty af. Started working in the pharma industry in the last two years of my bachelor's. After getting a degree I worked a year at a small lab producing fucking awful chemicals which took a big toll on my physical health. I thought the problem was me not having a master's so back to uni and started a process engineering master's. Jokes on me the curriculum was like 80% chemical engineering with almost no opportunities to work on stuff connected to IT. Luckily I found a PhD student who worked with simulations and life cycle analysis and he saw something in me. I got the task of ""try to predict the output of biomass gasification with neural networks"" with the note that he can't really help me with the neural network part of the project. I took a course in matlab that year and on that basis I have successfully completed the task (let's not go into details of how good that ANN was). Next year he left the university and there wasn't anyone in any chemical engineering related department who could understand the slightest bit of this ANN based project. That was the point where I said FUCK THIS SHIT I'M OUTTA HERE. started learning autonomously doing MIT's courses then finished a software testing bootcamp got my ISTQB-CTFL and here I'm working as a software tester for almost a month now. Can't stop won't stop moving towards complete understanding of deep learning right now and completing my lack of knowledge in areas related to computer science based on OSSU.Tldr don't let your childhood dreams stay dreams";jkcfqne;17djun;t8i3l3lk

My dad was one of the OG programmers working for the government on developing fusion technology he brought home his work computer when I was 5 and it quickly became my greatest interest.I remember when I was a bit older one day my dad took me in to the lab he worked at and there was a shared computer in a room available that I started noodling about on while he was working on some Fortran code.There was a video game where you didn't just play the character you programmed your robot and then you set them lopse in an arena where they fought against other robots.  The other particle physicists and engineers had made robots in the game and named the robots after themselves so I knew that if I could make a robot that could BEAT their robots then I would actually have outsmarted a particle physicist.So I set to work to do just that.  Every time I'd come with my dad to work I'd code and code all day the same as him except at this stupid robot game.I never made a robot that could beat any of theirs though.  But that set in motion the wheels that led to today.When I was a teenager started a BBS which became the precursor to the internet used it to congregate and hang out with a bunch of other nerdy kids from my school.So all that to say why well sometimes a hammer is just built for hitting nails.;jkcibce;ulr0i1k6;t8i3l3lk

"Money.Slightly longer answer: I have been programming for decades. Somewhere along that time I got an unrelated degree and then an unrelated job.

Yes it is..I would also love to play video games but it is for slackers and unmotivated people..but the thing I like about video games or even addictive social media sites like Instagram is the underlying technology that drives that. People make up thousands excuses to play video games just don't cheat with yourself telling this lie.;jk98dty;8urdpu341;t8i3l3lk
Somewhat similar age/career trajectory for me too. Isn't it a little frustrating how difficult an EE degree is compared to CS yet how the compensation generally increases the closer you get to the software? Wish I had known back then!;jka2wjo;bb4fa;4sj2rec5
Pretty much the same loved computers and gaming consoles as a kid and tinkering. Did a little bit of low level programming in HS and then went for my Computer Engineering degree. I‚Äôve been working in tech ever since graduating and it really hasn‚Äôt felt like work for me but more like continued education while growing my skills except my teachers are my managers and they pay a lot of money to me instead lol.;jka2jjk;17k6no;4sj2rec5
It was called a bubble for a reason. Tech is extremely vulnerable to hype. This still happens to this day. Mention crypto or AI and VCs pour money.;jkaowpv;20cqegxj;53bpbucj
"If you have to constantly ""find energy"" to do something that might be an indication that you may not actually like doing it.For those who truly like tinkering hearing about some new obscure technology thing feels like getting a shiny new toy to play with.";jk9r68q;3htbf;15bm4a

Thanks for the dose of reality! I've been working my first job since March. Pay is decent and I've actually been enjoying the mental work. I get that I'm a junior though and as I gain experience I'll have to solve problems that are a lot more ambiguous.;jk9gd4t;12z23z;5qz2w

So I only learned R during school and got experience with SQL in my internship as an business analytics. I wanted to stay in analytics and work my way up from there but none of the companies I applied for offered me anything the most I got was last round of interview. In the meantime I got multiple recruiters reached out to me on LinkedIn and asked if I was willing to interview for Software Developer I wanted a job it wasn‚Äôt bad so why not and at least I‚Äôd get interviewing experience so I went and got an offer the next day (still amazed at how that happened)Got laid off during covid so trying to go back to Data applied for entry level Data Analytics/ Data Engineer (2YOE in dev at the time). I told them I have been learning Python on the side they even comment that it shouldn‚Äôt be hard for me to do it since I know OOP and again most I got was last round of interview. I was unemployed for 9 months I was so tired with rejection and so decide to apply for few dev jobs and got an offer for dev. I‚Äôm not at where I want to be today actively taking Udemy courses for Data Science on my free time (my employer paid for our yearly subscription but don‚Äôt care what we learn) and would like to switch to Data again but later because we all know how hard it is for tech right now;jk9b896;k37cqst5;4698yqrl
It helps me understand more about algorithm for sure. Advanced math classes like number theory optimization linear algebra differential equations real analysis stochastic processing were good to know in SWE (my school strongly recommended CS student to take some of these for their capstone) but a lot of my classmates CS major hate math so they only take the required one;jkah8cm;k37cqst5;3uoce3bn
"They learned in the 1960s and retired in the 90s (at different times).  In the 1960s a CS degree didn‚Äôt exist; they both had Math degrees I think.  I‚Äôve already had a 25 year career; I learned in the early 90s.  So yes a while ago.";jk8zhla;q40ylesy;t8i3l3lk

"Think this is bad for many mobile games and games with ""shops"" and the like.Most regular people don't obsess so much about games min-maxing etc. but grab some Uncharted or whatever play it over the course if a couple months likely never finish it and then never touch again.I played too much Ultima Online when I was a teen around 1998. Home from school and then till 3AM.But after that the obsession wore off quickly once I got older. Still got good jobs BSc MSc PhD with distinction did 3-4 times gym and martial arts a week.And once kids are there you can be glad to find an hour every two weeks in the evening ;).During my PhD me and my wife played a lot of LOTRO and Guild Wars 2 after work. But when you're in work you're in work so didn't really affect that.And yeah then came the kids lol. Hope we can get to Diablo 4 in a couple weeks but most of the time we're just too wasted in the evening. Console works from time to time but moving our tired corpses into the PC room no way. Spider webs everywhere ;)But to circle back - I am glad I did not go into game dev. Games can bring joy in tough life situations and get you through them also can help bonding with others (played a lot with my parents and still great memories like Baldurs Gate 1 over LAN with my father and now I played Zelda BOTW and Stardew Valley with my daughter).But I know I would just be too pissed to work overtime just for some weird game bugs or mechanic because IT'S SO MANDATORY and life critical that this game comes out at date X otherwise people DIE).Ok gotta wake up that lazy kid #2 ...";jkc2631;zwqehho;8urdpu341
Eh I never considered majoring in CS to begin with so it doesn't bother me the slightest especially since it all worked out in the end.

I like tinkering more than work. I don't even think I want to work at this point but I will tinker any day of the week. Send help lol;jkadyqg;3i7ao4bs;3htbf
I think my issue is 10 hours work day? I'm trying to find energy to tinker 3 to 4 more hours. The only method that I found to consistently work is chill at Starbucks after work and tinker by writing code by hand.;jkakl1n;15bm4a;3htbf
"While this might be true i found that back then when I did a regular in-office job where I got back at 7PM (start commuting at 8 start at 9 8 hours plus and hour lunch break and then an hour commute back) I was usually completely done My wife then also got home and prepping dinner laundry showering Walking the dog and then just dropping dead on the couch.That's completely different when working from home though. Not only because saving commute but being at home also drains me much much less than driving around and being stuck with other people all day (well yeah introvert).Even though I we now have kids since 7 years ago I started being fully remote sice then I got more tinkering done than before with being in the office ;).At least when it was 1 kid only. Since they became two day usually ends after 9PM and then dead again ;) (but then my job is now R&D so there is enough tinkering anyway)";jkc0g9n;zwqehho;3htbf

That's crazy. I thought you need to know other languages to work as SWE. I'm kinda in the same boat. I only learned R in school and picked up SQL & Python during my data internship. I thought I'm not qualified for SWE roles because they want  something like C++ Java etc..;jk9ga89;8evf0mns;k37cqst5

We didn‚Äôt ask your opinion of video games üòÇ;jk9c725;a59xd2k9;8urdpu341
I feel you I did the same thing when I got to college. Quit video games completely. Bought a laptop with no graphics card to keep myself from playing them.Since then I have gone through phases of life where I‚Äôve had unhealthy video game habits but it was usually more a symptom of other problems I was having in life that I was trying to escape.Nothing like the compulsive Reddit and YouTube usage I have problems with now. IMO smartphone apps are way worse than video games. With video games you have to make the decision to pick the game up and start playing. Cellphones are so much more accessible and the dopamine hit you get is instantaneous.I should be asleep right now but I‚Äôm responding to people‚Äôs comments on Reddit lmao.;jkbpbfc;7uidi32p;8urdpu341

I've been employed at a WITCH company for a year now and I hate it. Since the moment I started I was looking for jobs but I have had no luck I have no internships or projects and I'm currently on a project working on an SQL database so I have very little time to put into projects leetcode school or job hunting prep. Should I continue with the job and just have very little time to job hunt or do personal projects or quit and try to find a different job while having more time to focus on projects and grad school? basically just wondering if the sentiment is the job market will stay the same or get better within a year;13icqmf;kmf5w;
Unless it's an extremely abusive situation you should continue working at your current job and search for a new one on the side. The job market at tech companies is pretty bad right now so most people assume it will eventually get better we just don't know when.;jk972ra;ao9779fg;kmf5w
What is WITCH?;jk94t38;g83thvku;kmf5w
Scale back on your work and start looking for another job. Do 80% push back on deadlines and don't go volunteer for things you don't need to do. Worst case scenario they fire you and you'll be able to look for a full time job like you were going to do anyway. Best case scenario you find a job while you're still employed.;jka6zad;86eed2jx;kmf5w
Start to work less until they notice you than put 5% extra effort.;jk9v48h;7bfpak3f;kmf5w
"A job is better than no job. I was in your situation was employed at WI(T)CH. Was put in a support role that involved no coding whatsoever. After 3 months with the client I figured this was going to get me no where in my career and started applying to other places. Took me 5 months of applying before I finally got an offer as an actual Software Engineer at a different company. What I noticed was that I was getting callbacks and interviews a lot easier than I was right out of college with no job. Recruiters were also messaging me more often on LinkedIn. Since most of the people applying for entry level jobs right now are either unemployed or not employed in tech currently having a job in tech will make your application stand out a lot more compared to the dozens of other applicants who applied. With regards to not having time for interviews what I did was schedule my interviews during my lunch break.Tl;dr don't quit and just apply to new jobs while working take the interviews during your lunchbreak. Currently having a job in tech will make your application stand out more.";jka1mwp;1l548pso;kmf5w

I was at a Witch from 2022 to 2023. I joined caused no one else would hire me. Pay was bad. Like 45k. But I was able to work at Apple DevOps team and learned a lot. Hated my team and manager. After 1 year  I left without a job lined up. Fortunately I was able to leverage that experience to get a really good paying job in NYC for 80k as a systems analyst. Starting on June 1. So I would recommend to weather it out. But if it's really bad...then make sure you have money saved up  get a part time job and grind jobs also new skills via Udemy and make sure to revise your resume. You can look at my post history to see what resume got me hired. ..Good luck. I know the job market is shit.;jkaq0b2;slvf9l8d;kmf5w
"Could you explain why you think you don't have time? You have the same time as the rest of humanity to do things it's just a matter of what you prioritize.I'd personally rather bring in money than zero money.If you want to do more development or create side projects or practice leetcode you're going to have to give something outside of code. It sucks but that's reality you need to choose what is important to you. If it's getting a job yeah you're going to have to do more programming in general; both outside and during work. You might have to forgo a vacation or hanging out with friends or working out everyday or cooking elaborate home meals and that's okay.Contrary to bloggers and millionaires you actually CAN'T have it all. You're going to have to miss out on things luckily you can choose what to miss out on your own terms.I'd also forgo ""caring"" about the quality of your work just do the minimum and focus your energy on learning/creating outside of work.edit: from another comment you work full time AND go to school for a graduate program congrats you chose that graduate school is equally important as working. If you want to pursue other things (like projects or leetcode I personally wouldn't bother with LC) you need to cut something out. Personally I'd wait until you get your graduate degree to make your next move otherwise you're stretching yourself way too thin and will definitely burn out/depress yourself.

Now I‚Äôm in support project and I took up that project to expose myself to a different kind of applications and frameworks. I couldn‚Äôt believe my ears when I got in to a dev project.

thank you for the advice;jk9v2i4;kmf5w;32u1d
Good advice but a lot of people on this forum are all about ‚ÄúI make 300k a year why am I so poor‚Äù.I agree with you though grind grind grind until they can get something better.;jka0u2v;12vbvc;32u1d
roughly operates like a normal company the training was free and ive always had the same salary even while training id have to repay the signing bonus if i leave before one year but im past a year now so i could quit anytime;jkaizfg;kmf5w;ezscj
People have been saying ‚Äúrecession soon recession probably in a few months‚Äù and act like we aren‚Äôt already in a recession with Feds raising rates every meeting and layoffs all around. Market outlook actually looks better now than it did a few months ago.;jkb9bj6;i96bh;uc7wibo8

Yes I like money. Rather spend the extra time to climb corporate ladder for more money;jkaklui;13cni6;3zrf5of7
Oh you passed a year and that company didn‚Äôt hire you on? Bad sign. Get out of there asapEdit:  and by that I mean get hired before you quit your first job;jkaj3o2;ezscj;kmf5w
It‚Äôs going to get worse;jkbb2lc;uc7wibo8;i96bh
Nah it will eventually get better like all things but things are not going to great for the next 18 months at least;jkbcd2x;uc7wibo8;12cyq64y
im curious is it common to get hired on if contracted? my project didn't start immediately so i havent been on it the full year just employed with the witch company a full year. my project is for a pretty big name tech company do they typically hire their contracts?;jkajgle;kmf5w;ezscj
Not every recession has to be like an insane crash like in 08 and every other person is out of a job. The S&P 500 already tanked 25% from it's peak back in October. It's like you people aren't happy until everyone is out of a job and struggling for their lives. The fed specifically said they are trying to go for a soft-landing and so far it's been pretty mild with inflation coming down which means their plan is working.;jkbbg95;i96bh;uc7wibo8
It‚Äôs fairly common. Usually companies know that after a year you‚Äôll be looking for better pay. So they are proactive about it and steal you from the witch company before the first year is up.;jkajszh;ezscj;kmf5w
I agree but we‚Äôre not at the peak;jkbc9tw;uc7wibo8;i96bh
interesting i wasnt aware probably too late for me as im just looking to get out as soon as possible at this point so ill probably take the first offer i get. thanks;jkak84j;kmf5w;ezscj
You mean bottomed out? We've seen nothing but slow and steady recovery since the bottom of Oct. GDP growth was negative for the first 2 quarters of 2022 if anything we don't see the ridiculous growth from the Covid bottom but a more steady and healthy recovery moving forward. GDP for the past 3 quarters are showing this. If the market continues with this slow growth then a soft-landing is indeed in effect and better off for everyone instead of the armageddon scenario you're hoping for.;jkbda5c;i96bh;uc7wibo8
What he said is very client dependent don‚Äôt worry about the whole year mark thing. I‚Äôm at TCS and it‚Äôs normal for people to be rotated to different clients/teams every two or so years. My company hires a ton of our contractors but not after a year. Normally 3+ years from what I‚Äôve seen.;jkbqlsv;1izjixki;kmf5w
Looking  at GDP alone is extremely misleading;jkbnonv;uc7wibo8;i96bh
Except I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôve mentioned the inflation rates interest rates and actually listen in on FOMC meetings on what the fed is doing and are planning to do.;jkbo7tq;i96bh;uc7wibo8

24M.I graduated last year with an applied mathematics degree. I have been unemployed for a year and have not been able to find a decent job with my degree.So far ‚Äúwork‚Äù as a tutor. I make about $50 a week.I am poor. Don‚Äôt have money to buy a coding boot camp course. I am just self teaching myself how to code.  I am interested in these fields: - data science data analyst software engineering front-end development web development.I have applied to 600+ jobs and received no job offers. I am at my last point I‚Äôm thinking of just joining the Air Force. I saw that they have ‚Äúcomputer systems programming‚Äù. The description and title itself is pretty vague. But at least it‚Äôs a ‚Äútech‚Äù job.Does anyone know any more details on this? Is this a good option?Should I avoid joining the Air Force? The pay is not great.Should I just keep going the self teach route?Edit:Thank you for the comments but I am still confused. Some have said it‚Äôs a great options. Other have said to avoid it at all costs. Still unsure.;13ijcoa;2uas1gf2;
Enlisting in the military as someone with a four-year STEM degree is pretty stupid no offense. If you want to join the military you want to **commission** not enlist. Joining as an officer immediately gives you much better pay prestige and career progression. You get a better house a better room on the ship (in the navy) everything is better.Conveniently for you the Air Force wants applications for cyberspace roles: https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/3368057/cyber-direct-commissioning-program-enhancement-to-onboard-future-cyber-officers/;jkan0sm;713yr;2uas1gf2
OP with a STEM degree absolutely do not enlist. Go officer or get the military out of your head and dont listen to anyone who tells you otherwise. I was enlisted then got out got a CS degree and got a job and I would never do it the other way around.;jkavmdt;3c07q9pc;2uas1gf2
Do not enlist to get a tech job. Repeat.At worst go into Officers course and get a shiny butter bar.If you really want to break into IT apply to work L1 at an MSP. Be prepared to hop if they're complete cancer. If not work there 2-3 years get your certs. Then find the grown up IT environment and really start to progress your skillet.I am an IT manager. Do not enlist to get IT experience.;jkbbclx;tso64;2uas1gf2
Just remember that when you join the military you have no say in what your specialization is going to be. Even if you have obvious qualifications they may decide they need you to be a typist or a helicopter mechanic like my cousin.;jka8jiv;la5mn;2uas1gf2
look at other civilian/IC jobs in the DoD and other fed jobs as wellhave you applied to any defense contractors as well?assuming your background is fairly clear e.g. no drugs/record;jkagxm6;3ahwym06;2uas1gf2
Definitely go in the officer route not enlisted. My son just graduated with an applied math degree luckily he found a job. If he hadn't I was gonna suggest an air force officer route;jkaxoli;9lcb0qfb;2uas1gf2
"Commissioning would be ideal but enlisting in the air force isn't that bad of a deal. The pay isn't crazy bad - in your first year you'll take home like $2000 a month but if you have no dependents you have no living expenses except for what you create. Housing is free no utilities free healthcare okay ""401k"" food is free. After 2-3 years you'll likely live out of the barracks and your pay will probably be 4-6k take home a month.There's also the experience. There's alot of shitty parts of the military. But it's also an opportunity to experience so much - living in Hawaii or overseas (pay scales to cost of living via housing allowance). Potentially interesting TDYs - I have a friend who has volunteered to go to Korea a few times for a couple of weeks each time has a ton of fun.If you pick the right job you'll have no problem jumping right into a lucrative career right when you get out. Veterans have so many resources for careers it's crazy how much easier it is to find a job as a veteran if you have the background.";jkb87v4;7te36;2uas1gf2
As an Air Force member. I would stay away man. Grab a part time job if you are really super worried. Enlisting will pay very low and the chance you get the experience you want is VERY slim. Going the officer route is more lucrative but would probably take longer at this point than just finishing a CS degree and getting a CS job. The process is long and the odds of getting through after 2022 is pretty low.;jkb1c1d;8fkyi66r;2uas1gf2
There are entry level civilian software jobs with the air force I've seen them hire people with little to no prior training. Look at USA jobs;jkaz897;n32aqqy5;2uas1gf2
I'd say go for Tata (TCS) or Cognizant before that at least then you won't have to deal with the contract requirements of the military. They're basically tech mega-firms that hire anything with a pulse. It may not be glorious but it's a start.;jkb9xtk;y4b5e;2uas1gf2
How the heck can you not get a jerb with a mathematics degree? What city do you live in op? Just feels like you live farm country. I mean off the top of my head if things really were that bad you could substitute teach or get a teach cert and make 50k a year as a teacher easily. Not to mention financially sector or banking.;jkbchav;507uchmb;2uas1gf2
Applied Math grad here working as a SWE for a fintech. Just keep trying;jkbt6sh;sg3mhaid;2uas1gf2
I did the same thing and it is worth it. It looks great in resumes and people in Defense perk up when I tell them. The Air Force is also paying my tuition and you always have a job food and home if things go wrong.;jkayf6n;58bjtucj;2uas1gf2
I think it's an excellent choice regardless of what MOS you get. Having been HR in the army for nearly 6 years I've known/out-processed quite a few people who've found success in this field regardless of the MOS they had while enlisted. They utilized TA to get their degree while in and got a modest amount of credits transfered to their college of choice via their JST (credits for your technical training and misc from basic training). Additionally they found said success without any projects or internships.Moreover the military helps you better your soft skills and instills discipline;jkaurgs;5bi8e;2uas1gf2
Sounds incredibly bad. You should be targeting 10 applications per day in different locations.;jkarv9j;ukeubsd5;2uas1gf2
Why don't you just pull school loans and finish a BS in computer Science. If you have applied mathematics at any reasonable place most of your degree has already been done. Depending what state you're in this opens up a lot of funding / job opportunities to things you otherwise wouldn't have. Lemme put it to you this way you've already went a year without what's another year to finish a more relevant degree (sorry data bros) while building a more robust portfolio / resume and networking?;jkaw2en;brdt3;2uas1gf2
Maybe skip the service and go witch or go service with a tech mos that will be your out of service career too. If your gpa is strong try commissioning.;jkb5wvu;yj9wbaj;2uas1gf2
If you go the military route commission as an officer in the Air Force or Space Force. Don't enlist. Enlisting is a great deal if you're 18-21 and don't have a skill a degree or any opportunities but that's not you. I enlisted at 21 and it was the best thing I ever did but I also didn't have a STEM degree at the time. I've been thinking about going back as an officer once I finish my CS degree in the summer.;jkbbjpm;8mf5a8oy;2uas1gf2
I would love to see you resume. This just feels like youve dropped the ball at the most basic places/situations.;jkbcoh2;507uchmb;2uas1gf2
I would also recommend you to look into the air national guard.;jkbcpay;ht3joo64;2uas1gf2
You applied to 600+ jobs and didn't get any offers? Are you sure it's not an issue with your resume? Does your local library or alumni office at your university provide career counseling and resume reviews? I would put as many programming-related/tech-adjacent qualifications on your resume as possible.As an applied mathematics major did you analyze any data? If so that's absolutely a project you can throw on your resume and throw in some data science jargon in there. Bonus points if you can try to recreate that work with Python then you basically succeeded at recreating one of my 400-level data science classes.Also I bet if you are able to do basic coding you could absolutely get hired by one of those contracting companies like Cognizant or Tata. My entry-level new hire group (at one of the competitors) was filled with people who did not have bachelors in CS. Many of them said they did other degrees and happened to complete one CS 101 class while they were in university. They will teach you coding again when you're hired and you'll get paid while they look for job placement for you. I have also been told that military contractors are always hiring.;jkbdgkq;n5cya;2uas1gf2
Assume you work in addition to the tutoring job. Is it not possible to save up the money for a bootcamp? Joining the military after having the degree seems a little extreme/unnecessary.;jkbksf1;f1rxq4p;2uas1gf2
"I talked with a director of software engineering at cap one who went this route and he said it was good.https://www.airforce.com/careers/detail/computer-systems-programmingI'm not big on the officer route unless you want to be a manager. Officers aren't the people doing things they're the people telling other people to do things. If that appeals to you then you'd pursue OCS: https://www.airforce.com/training/military-training/ots/overview> Some have said it‚Äôs a great optionsI mean... it's not a great option. It's the ""I can't find any other job and the economy is probably going to get worse so fuck it I just want to start my career"" option.If you have nothing else working joining the military is fine imo. Just make sure that when you sign the contract it has your MOS spelled out and do not believe a single thing the recruiters tell you about ""you can change it after basic training"". No you can't.I'd dig through the archives and read about the job: https://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/search?q=computer+programmer&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=allOverall the air force is the least military of the branches and they tend to treat people pretty well for the military. But that's still pretty dogshit compared to the civilian world.I was army a million years ago. Whatever you do don't enlist and go infantry. lol.";jkbn7uw;ae7sn;2uas1gf2
You seem pretty lost and confused floating through life. Military will give you a purpose. I'd highly recommend you do it. Being a veteran opens up LOTS of doors by the way. You become the ultimate minority and companies are REQUIRED to hire Veterans.;jkbnfts;10xq6a;2uas1gf2
You don‚Äôt need boot camps to learn CS most top universities post their courses online;jkbuqmn;5o30e;2uas1gf2
rather show us your resume. Math is more than enough for CS degree applications. Chances are there is some problem with the resume. Work on a project and do neetcode. That‚Äôs the usual recommendation for entry level jobs. Coding boot camps are scams;jkbyybe;15x241y4;2uas1gf2
"Honestly trying to get a tech job these days is hard. You have an applied mathematics degree which is great for a lot of careers but you'll have to contend with hundreds of thousands of fresh grads and experienced developers in this current market for very little openings for junior roles. Now joining the air force to get that experience is not what I'd recommend. A lot of people won't recommend the military. I personally don't have experience with it but I've had friends who attempted to gain experience from the navy and the air force only to get left behind in the current tech market. It does not always translate well. Military and government installations are usually very behind technology-wise unless you're part of cyber security organizations. Most of the tech comes from third party contractors or other companies.A better question to pose would be do you really HAVE to be in tech? If you do I recommend finding internships since you don't have a formal background with software engineering. That's not to say you can't learn quickly but most burn out since they're in it for the money which is fine. I'd also explore other areas like finance or actuarial jobs in the meanwhile. Your degree lets you go into different disciplines. Tldr: I'd really advise against joining the air force for ""tech experience"".";jkbzztr;17blq9;2uas1gf2

You are applying to CS jobs but what is your skill set?  Companies will obviously have to onboard you but if you have close to 0 technical skills or knowledge then you will most likely never be hired. You have to put some effort learn some technologies and create some projects.;jkcck97;pv4wr30t;2uas1gf2

Joining as an officer immediately gives you much better pay prestige and career progreI 100% agree with you that OP should pursue a commission but he should also understand that a commission is not easy to get. You need to have a high GPA and a great package and even then the process can take years.;jkbc3lr;ht3joo64;713yr
HAHA good luck getting a commission. Plenty of people with STEM master's degrees leadership experience ect. are not allowed OCS/OTS packets even if they recruiter shop. I knew plenty of well qualified people with great packets give up after going through all the branches. Even Army is turning down exceptional people. We got too many well educated folks with degrees and too few people to fill enlisted spots.;jkbj4sn;vxeuubrg;713yr
I know I have a STEM degree but I can‚Äôt get any jobs with my math degree. I would‚Äôve gone for something more practical like CS or engineering.

Yup.- And I had 3 ‚Äúcareer‚Äù college advisors look at my resume. They did give me good advice about re wording my resume. They also get very busy so I could only do so much. I also had 3 other sources look at my resume (brother friend college advisor). All say it was ok.- I had a couple math algorithm projects I listed on my resume. Not really related to SWE or web development. It was more related to data science? Not sure but the projects were more focused on the math. - both my math projects were programmed using MATLAB. Which I‚Äôve heard is not really a programming language. And that‚Äôs true I know how the project works it‚Äôs just math. I can just learn the python syntax and code if there. That‚Äôs a great idea. I‚Äôll look into implementing that into my resume. - ‚Äúcognizant / Tata‚Äù. What is that? Sounds like revature where they recudirte anyone but under the condition of a 2 year contract. And if you break the contract you will have to pay like $20k. Can you tell me more about that? Are they similar? Also I have 5 different resumes for different positions. That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt share them here because it might be confusing. If you want to see them pm me. Ty for the advice;jkbjwet;2uas1gf2;n5cya
Plenty of qualified people getting rejected from WITCH Genspark Revature ect. In normal times OP would receive 10 offers by now.

Hopefully I can get a job. I have an interview tomorrow at Jamba Juice. At least it‚Äôs something that can pay me more.

At first I was interested in actuary roles. I applied but they decided not to move forward because of my experience. I only had 3 fast food jobs and 1 supermarket job while in college.I then decided to get any job related to tech. Even the slightest. I applied to data entry putting numbers on an excel sheet. They did 2 interviews and they decided to not choose me.Then I decided any job (except fast food). Jobs I applied varied from Nike shoe stocker to T-Mobile sales rep. No job offers.I realized I couldn‚Äôt get any job. So I went back to math. The only thing I‚Äôm good at. I started tutoring math to students but only make $50 a week. I only work 3hrs a week.Now that I can‚Äôt even land a job I‚Äôve decided to just get any job. (That was the advice I got from the advice sub reddit). I have an interview tomorrow at Jamba Juice.

Did you learn anything in your math degree ? No offense but with a pure mathematics degree you should be able to proficiently leet code DSA with like 3 months of practice;jkbzvwn;bnayd;2uas1gf2
Join the military if you want to join the military. If you just want to be a software engineer there are better paths. Each branch does things differently. For example the Army has pretty much always guaranteed a specific MOS (or at least the training for a specific MOS but that's a different story) whereas the Air Force typically doesn't guarantee a specific AFSC. The Air Force process usually has you pick 10 or so jobs or an aptitude area and then you get one of those jobs. You can insist on a specific job and keep showing up to MEPS until a slot appears but some recruiters wont play that game. Recruiters will make up all kinds of bullshit so do your research before you talk to one.;jkacx6n;ijw1rfnx;2uas1gf2
When you go through MEPS you will sign a contract.  That contract will determine your job unless something disqualifies you after you start bootcamp.That something could be- Medical/mental issue- Inability to do the job.  eg couldn't cut it as a navy seal too stupid to pass basic tests during technical school etc.- Insubordination.- Didn't look at the contract and they pulled a sneaky on you.;jkar0en;yh9pfzl;2uas1gf2
I can't speak for the Air Force but for the navy they give you a list of jobs based on how to score on the asvab. Also you can go for it and try to join and if you don't get offered the job you want just don't sign the contract. Also don't sign a contract off of a verbal promise for said job. Make sure it's on the contract.;jkb38tb;5r9ek5tt;2uas1gf2
All they can guarantee is that they'll give you a chance to go to the school for your specialization if and only if it's in the contract you sign but there are ways to get around it if they want. My buddy went into the Navy with the express condition that he would get sent to flight school but he failed his medical because he had taken ADHD medicine at one point in the last 7 years and is now doing clerical work. Air Force gets to be even more selective about who they want so it's probably even less negotiating.;jkaepml;7c47g0p1;2uas1gf2
My brother declined a few jobs before joining so there may be some truth to that;jkaibcx;17dda4;2uas1gf2
That was just wildly incorrect. The air force lets you pick your MOS.;jkb1ule;28hwxu;2uas1gf2
Yes you can be that recruit but good luck getting any recruiter to work with you. Even with highly cleared tech roles / officer roles you're still wanting to pick one of the more sought after jobs in the military that won't necessarily get you anymore luck / experience than you're already at. Also good luck getting what you want without a six year contract. Like the other poster said join if you want to join but don't join with the prospects of being an engineer.;jkau0e0;brdt3;2uas1gf2
\>wants to join the military\>Doesn't know what DoD isBruh;jkanbg1;5sacl;2uas1gf2
"Ok this made me laugh üòÇ. How do you not know what DoD is and think about joining the military? DoD stands for ""Department of Defense"". It's the department that looks over all military operations.";jkb1yu5;575e8jqdc;2uas1gf2
I believe we have found why you have an applied mathematics degree and no job after a year.;jkcrktl;vmzhaswd;2uas1gf2
Just put this down for a few weeks because you don't seem to truly understand what you're asking to sign up for.  * Enlisted vs officer is wildly different* job vs job is wildly different* duty station vs duty station wildly different On top of all of that the mil work experience is really only super valuable when moving into DoD otherwise it's a crapshoot with employers.;jkb7rry;brdt3;2uas1gf2
Easy answer is that an officer is management and enlisted are the workers. With a degree you should look into being an officer first but you have to want to be a leader to be one. The entry bar is higher for officers but even then I would say that enlisted is the bottom of the barrel option.;jkb8xfm;10r9qk;2uas1gf2
Commissioning means you are an officer not enlisted. There's a whole bunch of technical differences behind the scenes but it basically means you are a manager.E1 through E9 are enlisted O-1 through O-9 are officer. Officers require a degree and are paid higher. For enlisted your normally E5 around year 4-6 to give you a rough timeline for promotion. You can Google a military pay calculator and look up what specific ranks get in specific zip codes. Remeber a large chunk sometimes 50% or more of pay is also tax free in the military.;jkbhrac;7te36;2uas1gf2
Air Force MOS = AFSC. But no my AFSC was exactly what I intended. I wanted to be a ‚Äúspace professional‚Äù and that is exactly what I was. One of the most techy AFSC‚Äôs or jobs you could get in the Air Force. As far as the job it wasn‚Äôt bad I just don‚Äôt want you to get it twisted. The ‚Äúexperience‚Äù you would get is nowhere close to the list of interests you listed in the initial post. As a matter of fact I‚Äôd say serving in the Air Force was good for stalling in life and that‚Äôs about it. I say this as someone who enlisted right out of high school at 18. The overall experience wasn‚Äôt bad for me and I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say that I regret it at all. But if I was in your shoes I wouldn‚Äôt take the enlistment route. Seems you have a stem degree and maybe wouldn‚Äôt be too far from a CS or software development degree if you were able to do school a tad longer. Which is what I would personally do. Reasons being because if you enlist typically the first year is pretty subpar training (and in my case it was a year and a half) before even being able to do what in the Air Force/space force is seen as a very technical job. In all reality it‚Äôs not as technical as it seems and what you end up learning/doing everyday doesn‚Äôt leave you with much knowledge and experience as one would probably want. On top of that enlisting leaves you with pretty shit pay. They will show you the benefits and pay scale and make it sound good but in all reality I was making 600$ 2 times a month for about 5 months before I got a promotion to 650$ 2 times a month for 8 more months before finally getting to 700$ 2 times a month. I quite literally was making more money in high school as a part time Walmart clerk. So reasons not to enlist: shit pay for long time not great ‚Äúexperience‚Äù and there‚Äôs a lot of red tape(dm me if you want to know what I mean cuz didn‚Äôt want this to be too long lol). Now like others were saying you could become an officer since you already have a degree and especially a stem degree. However becoming an officer is an extremely lengthy process. I worked with mostly officers and the minority were officers who became officers the non-traditional way(get degree-> go to OTS-> get assigned). I would hear CONSTANTLY how long these people had to wait before they were finally able to become an officer because the waiting list is long and the process is even longer(physical examinations tests paperwork and just waiting on people) and a lot of the times these people were waiting over 2 years from start to finish. On that note the life of an officer is pretty sweet. You have more responsibility but also ALOT more pay and more freedom. For the officers pay starts(depending on location as well because of housing allowance: I use CO springs for this example because it is where I was stationed) at about 70000 with no wife/ kids. Now for the experience they really got the same experience that I mentioned earlier being subpar at best but sprinkle in a bit of leadership/managing experience(still really nothing even remotely close to the interests you mentioned in the original post). That being said the officers have more of a chance to be considered for training and positioning in some of the interests you mentioned after some years served. Reasons to not become an officer: again the ‚Äúexperience‚Äù is not going to be what your desired tech experience until at least 3 years served before you even get a chance and it will most likely be over a year if not 2 before you were commissioned. If you have any questions feel free to dm me and I‚Äôll answer best I can. But if I was you and had the interests you have I‚Äôd just pick up a non related job work myself through a CS/SD degree then apply to desired jobs. Even a part time job will pay more than enlisting for about 2 years and commissioning will take about that long too. By then probably have a CS degree that makes the job search easier and more likely to hit. Because I promise the experience you would get in any of the more techy jobs really will not help very much for your interests. You‚Äôd more be stalling which is both respectable and understandably sometimes necessary but for sure there are better routes. Sorry for the long post and my wording may be bad in spots. Forgive me I am coming off a 12hr shiftü§£. Good luck whatever you decide buddy!;jkbtg3d;8fkyi66r;2uas1gf2
I don't think you realize just how bad and bureaucratic the military can be.  You have very little control over your career and at their disposal.  You'd be rolling the dice going enlisted with a degree.  You could be worse off than you are now after the military and 6-years older at 30.  I was in your shoes over 10-years ago having graduated from college during the Great Recession.   Maybe check out tech roles in the Air Guard or Reserve if you have a base nearby.  Please do your research before signing anything.  You could get clearance training build your network and work on a CS degree/portfolio in your spare time while in the reserves.;jkbuj3b;5o5tzkdx;2uas1gf2
Yeah you'd work on a base in Dayton or California or Florida but it's basically just a normal job - no basic training uniforms etc.;jkbkhgs;n32aqqy5;2uas1gf2

I doubt they recommended you to enlist instead since that would be pretty batshit to tell someone who just graduated. Also they're operating under the assumption you can get those jobs with just a math degree ( which you can ) a bs in cs will buy you more time and make you more desirable imo it's obviously more expensive that just getting the job but all are better than signing off 4+ years of your life unless you're just looking for you to tell you it's a good idea  it's not. Loans. Fed loans for what you can 12 to 14k per school year plus private to fill the gaps.  Take student jobs  work study  etc only afforded to current students.;jkb4fuz;brdt3;2uas1gf2

"Python has a lot of incredibly useful libraries for that kind of stuff I think with some good effort you could absolutely recreate your projects.Cognizant Tata Consultancy Services Revature are all similar.

They did however give me several raises on a 2 year ""new hire"" schedule. I wasn't able to negotiate my starting salary but it was also pretty much exactly average for a starting salary in SWE. I took the job because it was 2020 and my previous offer had been rescinded. The salary was good enough for me to feel comfortable and start paying off my private loans. The raises over the two years I felt were very good and I also got an inflation adjustment last year on top of the scheduled raises.Keep in mind I was a more qualified candidate and I do not know if the other new hires were let go or not.

If you're a good tutor you can get 50/hr. I don't know why you are getting 50/week. Go to a college and pass out flyers you tutor homework exam prep etc...And do not join the military.

Commission = officer.Officers are about 15% of the US military. They're basically the military's professional/leadership class. On your first day as an officer you outrank an enlisted airman who's served for 20 years. All pilots in the Air Force are officers so is stuff like signals intelligence engineering etc. All those military people you see briefing the president on TV? Officers.Nothing against enlisted folks but you're way overqualified. If you can't get a commission then do something else.;jkbj3yq;713yr;2uas1gf2

I think only the marines lets you ship out with any ambiguity of what you'll do any special role contracts always come with the stipulation you fail you're needs of the military (that branch). For most special operations /forces that means the worst jobs most of the time but like failing as a nuke potential isn't the same as failing BUDs.;jkauqq8;brdt3;yh9pfzl
You can sign for specific ratings /mos's but it's hard to both get a recruiter to actually work with you on that not fuck you intentionally and even when you do you have to pass what ever training they have for it. Flight school is one of those more special treated cases especially for the navy. A lot of more technical roles are forgiving because not a lot of people joining the military will ever qualify to even try for those roles.;jkaw2o8;brdt3;7c47g0p1

same thing lol I know it's not but might as well be for intent.;jkb8x5b;brdt3;3ysaf
Yes. You will need to be a leader as an officer. Being a bad leader will limit your career future in the military and you won‚Äôt be learning the technical skills or doing the technical work that it sounds like you are looking for as an officer. I know a lot of people here are telling you to become an officer because you have a degree. I guarantee the majority of those people have never been in the military.Also joining the Air Force as an officer is incredibly difficult if you do not go through ROTC or a military academy. It can also take a long time of waiting and that might not be an option to wait 6months to a year for boards etc. It‚Äôs actually a lot easier to become an officer after you enlist in the Air Force. I have several friends who have done it that way.;jkbt0xt;cwap57c;2uas1gf2
Yeah and honestly it probably rules you out because just to join you'll have to convince a recruiter (and possibly a board I'm not too familiar with the officer process I was only enlisted) that you have the desire and potential to be a leader. Just joining whether officer or enlisted is a big commitment that should probably just be your last resort.;jkct408;10r9qk;2uas1gf2

i can‚Äôt say for all WITCH companies but i did work for one of them. they didn‚Äôt make me sign any contract so no payment upon leaving since i was at-will. now for the fun part: is A LOT bad about them but if you have no options it‚Äôs not bad to get your foot in the door.going on the bad:1. the company paid me 54k a year. not bad for a new job but also not great compared to rest of industry 2. the ‚Äúbootcamp‚Äù (you get salary during the time) was 10 weeks where you are taught CS101 basics. nothing crazy but they make it sound intense and super important (it is in india but in US you‚Äôre just a number more explained below)3. you‚Äôre just a number. the real work is being done by the India engineers so you sit around all day on the bench (doing no work but still paid) waiting for a project to pop up on the internal boards. if you‚Äôre at a busy hub you can expect months sitting on bench. Now it‚Äôs not bad since you still get full salary but if you don‚Äôt work on improvement there‚Äôs nothing you can show off on your resume for future employers. 4. the projects assigned to you are basic QA/test jobs. you will NOT get any chance (or a small % may get lucky) of being able to touch any code. 5. WITCH companies have a terrible rep of bad engineers. Since the bar is so low the quality of work outputted is low from the start. Then there‚Äôs the fact that they‚Äôre contractors (no ownership of product) and lack of meaningful support means that some (read: FAANG elites) might look down on you. reading online it seems that a lot of people say working at WITCH companies is a dead end. I have to say I agree even though i dug myself out. The work there was pointless and consensus is that if you‚Äôre there for over a year and a half you‚Äôre probably stuck and will need to transition to a new industry. You will need to be a self starter and 1. find projects 2. find meaningful work in those projects 3. sell yourself despite having a ‚Äúnegative connotation‚Äù attached to the role.In my personal experience I got bored of babysitting pipelines and scripted up my own Python script to scrape a few internal tools and sites to congregate the data for ease of access.

OP framed it like an ass but saying *I don't have money to relocate* when job searching for 80k plus roles is kinda of silly since often they'll cover the relocation.

The Commissioning process is actually competitive as well as if selected it‚Äôs physically demanding to pass Officer Development School. A lot of running and much more mental than your regular boot camp as you are expected to lead enlisted airmen. Then depending on your career specialty your not really hands per say but more middle management. Maybe if your lucky you‚Äôll get to actually do your speciality past your first four years. Most Airforce pilots start moving away from the cockpit at around the 10 year mark and more into the operational planning and leadership roles. It‚Äôs not a bad way to set your self up but being an officer isn‚Äôt really I can‚Äôt find a job so I‚Äôll do this. It‚Äôs actually fairly selective. Look at the acceptance rate for all the service academies. Quick google search and it‚Äôs about 11%. The ODS rate varies from year to year and can take up to a year to put a competitive package together. Enlisting on the other hand if you have no preference for a specific job can ship you off significantly faster.;jkbrgu5;fzkc5;2uas1gf2
That‚Äôs an option I was also looking at. But I talked to a local community college advisor about it she said that it won‚Äôt make you ‚Äújob ready‚Äù/‚Äúis not enough for a job‚Äù.

I think that‚Äôs the thing. If you have a grade it may make it easier to be consistent with learning. Also maybe not ‚Äòjob ready‚Äô but being able to say you took xy and z class might be helpful as resume or talking points in an interview;jkbe6i7;bb70svz;2uas1gf2
That excuse won't help you either.Other modes of transportation exist. Other people have cars.;jkbhmtb;ukeubsd5;2uas1gf2
also just wondering but why are some people divided about the idea of joining the air force for experience?some have said its a great options others (like you) have recommended to not do that and instead follow a traditional path?;jkbg2m7;2uas1gf2;bb70svz
So maybe buy a plane ticket? Or borrow someone‚Äôs car to relocate? I don‚Äôt have much money. $2k;jkbixre;2uas1gf2;ukeubsd5
People are against the idea of you enlistingIf you enlist you‚Äôre essentially wasting your degree because if you enlist you‚Äôll be in exactly the same position as if you just enlisted before college.What people are encouraging is to look for a role that will essentially value your degree. A role that you may not be able to get without a degree because generally they are better pay better etc;jkc7rge;ksdo5;2uas1gf2

I am wondering if I am working too hard at my job bc I usually feel too tired to do much of anything after work. I cannot do too many chores or exercise. If I exercise I feel incredibly tired the next day I know exercise is supposed to be good for me but for my personally it makes me more tired and less functional. I‚Äôd like to hear how productive other full time employed software engineers are outside of work to give me a sense of what is perhaps normal. Maybe if you can share your title/level of responsibility your home life status like whether you live alone are a parent etc and what things you regularly do outside of work.Edit: thank you to all those who responded. I think increased indoor temperatures without AC while working remote is what has sidelined my productivity I think I‚Äôll be tackling that first.;13iq4vx;878657vp;
Life was a lot simpler when my work was just pouring out code and my personal life was just watching anime. I had no problems having enough oomf then.Now with a family and home ownership and medical issues and all sorts of other adulting things I find it a challenge to balance out all the aspects of my life that demand attention. I had to quit management because after dealing with everyone else's problems all day I couldn't deal with my own or my family's. The balance is still a constant struggle and one I have to keep a close watch on.;jkb40pq;3fta2;878657vp
I've a coworker who works on the weekend. As much as I can chat with them and make sure they aren't burning themself out it's their decision no matter how many times I politely bring it up. They're single and doing what they want to do in their free time. You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink.Whereas my other coworkers do a good job keeping work to their day hours maybe minus a few to run errands or do chores. We don't keep track too closely (don't abuse it and we're cool).For myself I keep a well defined work life separation. I work my 36 hour weeks and go the fuck home. I do my best to work out regularly (been focusing on distance running again with some light weightlifting). I make sure that my partner and I have dedicated time together a few times a week and enjoy each other as we both chase our careers. I try to keep up with old friends and make new ones at my Local Game Shop when I play Magic or DnD.Not to sound too much like a Saturday morning cartoon but I make sure to slow down and smell the roses. I enjoy the silver linings when I'm in a bad situation and prepare for the eventual change when I'm in a good one. Maybe that's a little too practical of me but hey ... I'm an engineer :);jkb7slt;isznhznw;878657vp
Senior engineer here engaged with a dog. Lifting 5x a week stationary bike while watching TV on lunch break and I walk my dog about 2 miles a day. Then hiking in the nearby mountains every few weeks with the fiance and friends.Put up dishes every day load as I use them keep kitchen clean after every use. Make the bed every day. Laundry once a week sheets once a week. Bathroom once a month vacuum and floors once a month. Fitness is a tough thing because when you stop doing it it becomes a massive chore and you feel tired all the time. Then getting back into it is exhausting for a month or so. But once you get it on track you feel so much better. You sleep better you work better and hell laying around doing nothing feels better.Similarly chores feel overwhelming when you let them pile up. If you force yourself to unload the dishes when they finish and load as you go they never pile up. You get into the rhythm.Think about work. What happens if you goof off for 3 days and get nothing done? It piles up.We won't be able to tell you if it's work or what but finding your rhythm that keeps everything flowing steadily is the key to not getting overwhelmed.;jkb92vp;9hevu8wf4;878657vp
Very I would say. I have two kids so most of my time is spent playing with them taking them to activities etc. I play rec league sports twice a week and go to the gym once per day. I'm usually doing between 12k to 18k steps per day.;jkb50th;328doggt;878657vp

"I have 2 kids a wife and a home to maintain. Being ""tired after work"" is simply not an option :)For me personally shit runs waaaayyyyy better when I am regularly physically active. Like ... everything. My mood is better I'm more productive more focused less ""crash"" towards the end of my day. More ""ok all done now time to rest"" as opposed to ""holy FUCK if I don't lie down I will perish"".That doesn't mean protein shakes and Stronglifts. It means mowing the lawn chopping wood squats with the kids on my back. Basic maintenance type stuff -- the equivalent of an oil change for my car but for my body. Not looking to get swole.I also understand that beyond physical activity I need mental activity. ""wins"". Clever puzzles to solve. I used to get those more regularly when I was an [IC](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/what-is-an-individual-contributor) they're tougher to come by in management. I have to be a little more deliberate in making space for those activities to take place. That doesn't mean burning the midnight oil on passion software projects -- sometimes it does (/r/homelab) the past few days I've just been fucking around with the new Zelda. Or something time-boxed and accessible when I have kids hovering around me like Hearthstone Battlegrounds -- ~15-20 minutes tapping my phone periodically to respond to the game state. Doing that instead of just mindlessly doom-scrolling Reddit.Take regular stock of your personal well-being -- [there's even a book for this](https://www.amazon.com/Wellbeing-Essential-Elements-Tom-Rath/dp/1531865305). Try stuff out. Make changes. Did your well-being improve? Decline? Stay the same? Measure. Iterate. Improve.

I'm the sole data engineer/backend developer for this project in a non-IT centred part of the business. I have a lot of responsibility in terms of choosing and setting up the db writing the data pipelines writing the API doing query optimizations etc. It's fun I try to avoid working long hours as it makes me feel exhausted throughout the week. I also make sure to get off my butt for 10-15 mins during the workday and just go for a quick walk and think about a problem I am stuck on while getting some sun.I go to the gym 3-4 times a week for 1-2 hours a session. I usually do these sessions Monday-Friday and then see my friends and gf during the weekend. I'm lucky and live with my family so I don't have to cook every single day but still cook regularly. I also realized that doing meal prep saves a shit ton of time. 1.5-2 hours of work can prepare you meals for days.I have a bad knee that has been reducing how far I could bike for years. I decided since this job pays decently well I may as well invest in personal training and rehab for my knee and exercising has become a habit for me.With that said I also take time to unwind I will maybe watch an episode of anime or something or play a video game for a bit if time permits. When I see my friends it could be anything like just grabbing a bite to eat going out and seeing a movie or go hang out at a boardgame cafe or something.;jkbe6rv;5p10k8xk;878657vp
Sadly when I go in-office and work I often get back home wanting to do more things. It's like I hate being in the office so much then I'm super happy and motivated when I leave the office. I actually don't mind going in-office(at my own free-will). Being at home all day really drains my energy to do chores.;jkbjp2m;57xmr3fu;878657vp
I'm pretty busy outside of work ‚Äì I ski bike run take care of my yard go see art and shows and things keep up with friends cook read etc. I've found that having sources of fulfillment that aren't work related is key to avoiding burnout. If all I have is work it's really hard to maintain a healthy level of mental distance and disengagement (and too easy to internalize the petty BS that comes with most jobs). Sometimes it's a lot but I'm thankful to be able to swing a leg over my bike and forget about office drama after a bad week.(staff SRE no kids 45-50 hours/week give or take);jkbmelk;14gmvg;878657vp

i used to go to the gym a lot before i had a full time job then becoming a front end dev i started to work out less. i noticed i was packing on belly fat and started to get overweight. now im trying to eat healthier and retrain my mind to eat less because back then i would eat a lot and train hard. the train hard dimmed out a little bit but my bad eating habits still linger;jkbq2cz;buq7nat;878657vp
I am able to stay pretty active. I have 4 YOE currently a mid level engineer in MLOps. I wake up at 6am everyday and strength train 4-5 days a week. I work remote and I have a home gym in my garage so it‚Äôs pretty easy to keep consistent. I only work about 9am-3pm.  I walk everyday about 2 miles after work. Then I cook dinner and relax for a bit. Around 7:30pm I do about 45min to an hour of mobility and rolling out. I‚Äôm usually in bed by 9pm and asleep by 10. On the weekends I go for hikes or skimboard at the beach. I wanna get a pair of rollerblades soon for another form of exercise. I currently live with my partner and our small dog. No plans for kids. I was not always this active. During Covid I was very depressed and gained weight. Over the past 2 years I have worked my way to where I am now. I have lost all the weight and then some.;jkbx7ji;55lu8diy;878657vp
Similar to some other posts here I'm married have 2 little kids (7 and 4) and am a fully remote Senior Software Engineer. From a BMI perspective I think I'm classified as obese and I'm not a very fit person in general.I didn't get a lot of activity besides walking up and down the stairs and playing with the kids at my old house about 5 times a day.   Moved to a new apartment recently which has a tiny gym about 10 meters away from our block so I've been going there for about 30 minutes every morning and following a workout plan from an app. I am feeling like I get more energy in the morning after starting this routine and I found when I'm feeling tired it's usually a lack of hydration that is the problem. So now I have a timer set for every 45 minutes of sitting down and working I need to take a 5 minute walk around the apartment and drink some water. My day is basically: Wake up (and whatever morning routine is needed :D) Gym Shower Coffee while watching youtube work with those 5 minute breaks until 12 then lunch then work until 2 with those breaks and then I'm in meetings/pairing calls for the rest of the day while I pace around the room. After work (5-6pm depending on if I spent work time in the gym or went out to the shop or something) is some family time and helping my wife around the house and then dinner put the kids to bed and then some nights it's watching TV with the wife or playing video games until like 11pm.;jkcdnve;xzrk5;878657vp
"I'm a senior engineer that works fully remote for a company that you know 6 yoe. I have a long term girlfriend who I live with but no kids. I cook for myself she cooks for herself (she's vegetarian and I am not) and we split chores fairly evenly.I squat/bench/deadlift 500lbs/315lbs/600lbs and train 4 or 5 days a week. Lifting and ~30 mins cardio 10-12 hours a week total. I ski and play ice hockey during the winter and hike during the summer and fall. My girlfriend and I regularly tackle 15-20 mile hikes with 4k+ feet elevation gain sleep in tents big packs the whole 9 yardsHonestly I prioritize my physical activity over my career but it's easy to do that with a comfy job and huge TC in a LCOL area. No kids means plenty of time. The main ""sacrifice"" I've had to make is simply less video games";jkbgrkg;507iz;878657vp

I'm either working gaming eating or sleeping. It's a very fine balance that anything additional that comes in throws that out of whack and I end up throwing PTO at it so it can replace work.;jkbyzrz;87kjvlgl;878657vp
I‚Äôm a young adult with no kids a few years of experience and I‚Äôm currently attending grad school. I try to stay productive outside of work but it is a bit difficult. Outside of work I drag myself to the gym 5-6 times a week. I try to do a cardio based-exercise (hiking running etc.. ) 2-3 times a week. I typically spend 15 hours per week on grad school. I spend an additional 10 hours per week on personal projects/learning. Any other free time is spent running errands chores tv etc..;jkc2adu;60o2t76l;878657vp
Fairly productive speaking from a strictly personal standpoint. I exercise about an hour a day. I clean the house cook meals do laundry clean and organize. I take care of the yard on the weekends. I grocery shop. I meet up with family and friends. I take care of my own finances and projects around the house.I also work quite a bit. I‚Äôm a principal engineer at a major tech company so the responsibility and demands can weigh heavy. It‚Äôs a balancing act. I have gotten better at this as I‚Äôve gained more experience in my career. The amount of completely frivolous time has dropped off so I‚Äôm not spending hours on video games every night anymore. But I still do watch TV shows and movies to relax in the evening. I put a ton of attention and mind space into work but I‚Äôve also learned how to ruthlessly prioritize. I aim to focus on the most impactful areas and have learned how to let good-enough lie in others. And I‚Äôve cultivated the ability to turn the switch off when I need to (though there‚Äôs still definitely inertia). Podcasts while doing other chores has been incredibly helpful for me. And audiobooks. Sometimes it‚Äôs educational stuff but often it‚Äôs pure entertainment. I can enjoy myself while folding clothes or sweeping the floor or breaking down recycling. It‚Äôs meditative in a way and lets me be productive without feeling like I‚Äôm just wasting time on drudgery. Just keep trying little things. Life goes by quick but it‚Äôs also long. Keep at it keep getting up when you fall down and you‚Äôll get there. Don‚Äôt get too down on yourself. We all have to walk this road.Cheers.;jkc5w10;gessrlhp;878657vp

I‚Äôm thinking of getting a cat and naming it fergie. I share a room with two roommates and we have a cat named Timmy who is a absolute sweetheart. That cat has more guts to enforce his boundaries and rules than me. And he‚Äôs more independent than me. For some reason he just hates dogs. He‚Äôs a sweetheart to those that leave him alone and behave nicely to him. He demands respect and in return he‚Äôs a absolute angel. You disrespect him the cat will give you a silent treatment for a long time. He‚Äôs saved us from bad people and he has a way of letting us know who he hates. I learned the value of respecting yourself from Timmy.Cats really do teach you a lesson on demanding respect. Timmy had a hard life as a shelter cat and being abandoned and still he was a strong cat and never gave up on life.;jkc0jh6;4epyrwh6;9hevu8wf4

I‚Äôve been seeing many self-taught programmer threads and videos too and also people saying that college is only really good for getting jobs easier at the start. But does college teach you any significant information regarding software engineering for example or do you have to learn 99% of the material in your own free time?;13iuwpe;534u2d0r;
"I think it cannot be understated that it requires an incredible amount of discipline to self-teach the same material in the same amount of time. You're never going to have those ""I'm fucked"" moments where you have to pull a miracle. There's nothing quite like the threat of wasted time money peer pressure and disappointing your parents that will light a fire under your ass.Whether all of that material is actually worthwhile to you is a different question.";jkbvwas;fdxl8;534u2d0r

I got my first SWE job after attending a bootcamp + a few months of self teaching. I decided to get my CS degree to make things easier on myself in future job searches but I didn't think I'd learn much. I learned a ton and it changed the way I thought about some problems. I didn't technically need to get a CS degree but I'm really glad I did.;jkct3ci;fr1gkzil;534u2d0r

"To be honest College helps give you direction if you do not know what to learn and how to learn. It also helps with your network as the peers you meet in college could help you land jobs or they can help guide you where to apply.&#x200B;Ultimately college or self-taught it doesn't matter as you would need to practice or learn topics on your own time anyway.";jkc9c8c;3xyhgtq2;534u2d0r
If you want a comparison:**University**Pros:- uni will guide you to become a complete programmer who understands from deep level (OS kernel memory cache etc) to surface level (application program)- Accreditation: a degree in CS is a validation of your skills and knowledgeCons:- very expensive- long time commitment with no income.- worthless after 3-5 years of work experience **Self-learning**Pros:- cheap flexible schedule- you learn what you actually wantCons:- you are likely to miss the theory and conceptual part of CS - hard to prove your knowledge and skills;jkbwskd;2jvyhe6o;534u2d0r
Universities give you the bigger picture view.  I participate in a military community that supports veterans with transitioning into tech jobs. Some members decide to go the self-taught / boot camp way.  The pattern I've noticed with this group is that they cannot climb over the early intermediate levels. They're familiar with current popular tools but they don't understand software architecture design patterns and how everything interconnects.  Yesterday someone was fetching a ton of data from their database straight from their React app and then sorting it inside the browser to find what they were looking for. I tried my best to help correct the approach but I could tell it really wasn't sinking in.;jkchi0q;21bp2h5d;534u2d0r
Gonna be in the minority here‚Ä¶ just finished my CS degree at a decent university. Feel like I didn‚Äôt learn shit. Could I have studied harder? Sure. But I graduated with a 3.5 and I paid attention. 95% of ‚Äúsoftware engineering‚Äù things I know I taught myself outside of school.;jkc5myd;jok7l;534u2d0r
If you want to do web development you probably won't experience much difference. If you want to really understand what's going on under the hood and become a knowledgeable worker that can do work in any related field you will get a huge head start. It's less about specific technical skills you get taught it's about how to approach problems. An overview what the fundamental problems are. A good introduction to a broad set of relevant technologies. How writing helps in thinking and problem solving ...;jkc1s5n;lfl3z;534u2d0r
My school taught a lot of language agnostic concepts.  I think it helped me see through the syntax to the semantics.  With a good understanding of language agnostic DSA swapping out the syntax of different languages is just a memory challenge.  College also taught me a lot of things that aren't just coding (some really important some maybe not) like: what a computer is base 10 vs binary time complexity multiprocessing how to write proofs OOP math.Even though I don't think my program prepared me for the latest tech stacks it definitely gave me a good foundation to build on.;jkc4kag;4ds79ir3;534u2d0r
If you learn on you own time and do research with a professor you get a chance to be noticeably good at a part of CS. If you stay on longer into grad school you become one of the most knowledgeable people in the world in a particular area. If you do really good it makes jobs easier too. I had a VP at a company you have heard of offer me a job on the spot after half an hour talking about my senior project. That would not have happened without using the university events to meet people. Even if you have to learn react on your own time or watch some youtube to understand docker that strong foundation will make the rest of your life easier. It gives you the option to take a troublesome piece of code and formally verify it so you never get woken up by it again while on call the option to debug the compiler or the OS instead of saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù and the option to build your own tools when what exists isn‚Äôt good enough. You can do that on your own but it will take much longer.;jkcl2bo;2uuylk7f;534u2d0r
A lot. It helps a lot. I've spoken with individuals at my company who hire and interview and they've all told me that there is an often times noticeable difference between 4 year CS degrees and 2 year code camps or certs.;jkcob2v;hdckq1m3;534u2d0r
As a side note this subs position on degrees vs boot camps/self-taught has definitely shifted. I definitely remember there being a lot more pro-boot-camp and pro-self-teaching comments and a lot more anti-degree comments but currently most comments seem pretty definitively in the pro-degree camp. I‚Äôm not a developer so I can‚Äôt really say why this is but if I had to speculate I‚Äôd guess the anti-degree sentiment was due to self-taught and bootcamp developers being able to get entry level jobs with less money/training making a degree seem less necessary but now that time has passed and people have been able to see and compare the career progression for degree and non-degree devs more and more people are starting to see having a degree as being a long term advantage. Again this is just speculation tho so doesn‚Äôt mean much.;jkcsjhg;6ixccf4r;534u2d0r
Quite a bit if you pay attention in algorithms and OS;jkct3as;k0j7v4s;534u2d0r
College is the superior way to learn CS. This seems like an unpopular thing to say some places on Reddit but coming from someone who started off as self-taught and went the college route‚Äîit‚Äôs the truth.Not only do you have to have an insane amount of self-discipline to stand a chance at self-teaching but there are also so many pitfalls along the way that you otherwise may not know to avoid. CS is so vast that it‚Äôs easy to go down rabbit holes for practically everything you study that aren‚Äôt worth your time after a certain point if your goal is simply to be employable.College will streamline the information into logical chunks and teach you in a pattern that makes sense. You‚Äôre learning from experts not just someone who can make a YouTube tutorial or write an article on GeeksForGeeks. College will also give you a solid theoretical understanding of CS which will ultimately improve your practical skills and teach you how to ‚Äúthink‚Äù in terms of code.And if all that isn‚Äôt enough justification for college consider the state of the tech market now. If nothing else college has always given companies away to efficiently filter out candidates for job postings. CS has been unique on this front until recently but the trend seems to be going in a direction where in most cases you‚Äôll want a CS degree to become a software engineer and especially if you want to be a data scientist.;jkctgg6;cnyjvg3i;534u2d0r
I don't think college actually teaches you how to do it. It provides structure / discipline which most college-aged people can't generate on their own for the years it takes to hone the skill.;jkctkza;ekcnruc4;534u2d0r
College will teach you how to teach yourself. It‚Äôs up to you to adapt to the ever changing landscape.;jkcyjf2;xegbp;534u2d0r
I‚Äôll go against the grain here and say that college teaches you a mish mash of theory that trains your brain but doesn‚Äôt directly teach you what you need to know on the job. Of course it is useful but maybe only 50% efficient since a lot of it is never applied. College students end up having to self teach anyway.;jkc0ycf;9t6ja;534u2d0r
I already started coding since I was young. I went to a top uni in my country and top uni in UK for computer science.They are only for opening doors (e.g. visa jobs). Other than that I didn't find it useful. Definitely isn't worth 6-7 years of effort.Self-taught is much faster and more interesting.;jkc83pr;27cbunjg;534u2d0r
It all depends on the quality of your uni's professors. In my case I had some amazing professors several of whom were already wealthy from their inventions in the field. The classes were incredibly challenging and soaked up every minute of my life but I learned concepts of hardware and software that I could not possibly have learned from a YouTube video. This foundation paved the way for an extremely rewarding career. I regret nothing about my strategy for preparing for my profession. YMMV of course.;jkbu7rj;1mhpr;534u2d0r
You'll learn the inner workings of compilers operating systems file systems assembly and processor architecture. So it helps to know what's going on under the hood when you write those fancy if statements üòâ;jkc22gr;rqg0y;534u2d0r
I find most self-taught trend towards coder rather than computer scientist. Coding is a basic foundation in CS programs and mostly covered by the end of the first year. The value add for CS are the technical topics like embedded OS distributed computing AI/ML GPGPU power safety etc. I also find self taught usually lack the SWE skills.;jkcbnn1;2sdopqd8;534u2d0r
Another thing that college does really well compared to self taught is an extra check in the box when it comes to the job search. Source: boot camp grad with no degree on month 3 of the job search;jkc2e6o;8830fb6d;534u2d0r
Bad ones aren't useful expect for the discipline it puts you inGood ones will teach you CS properly;jkc68ah;12102p;534u2d0r
Colleges hire professors. These professors are often the best in their field and have contributed to the field.;jkciwct;5psx3671m;534u2d0r
When I am adding junior people to a team I hire people who have published a project every time and only consider people with degrees if they have also have managed to keep the same job for more than 2 years and haven‚Äôt had more than 3 jobs. Also they have to sparkle a bit they have to show some element of passion and be interesting.  It might not be standard but I ask myself if I would enjoy Disneyland if I went with 1000 clones of this person.  Junior positions like a lot of positions are culture fit more than anything else. So if your college gives you real hands on projects which get published then cool. If you can do your own hands on projects and publish them on your own then cool.;jkcdfjd;avneoefg;534u2d0r
I am a cs student and I am telling you u can learn the whole cirriculm on your own own from the internet. college can get you in an interview but not a job. focus on doing projects and try to participate is oss anyone who is telling u its crucial are stupid ass people who only can invert a binary tree and its just pure flexing anyways.;jkcfu3p;jwl54ow8;534u2d0r
It depends. If you can't program by the time you enter college and think you're going to learn from scratch... you won't and you'll suck. But you'll have a credential and will get a job. The people who didn't need college to learn CS would blow you away when they're in middle school or high school.;jkc2tr0;n32aqqy5;534u2d0r
You will end up with a much more in depth understanding of the field if you do a degree at a good CS school. It‚Äôs incredibly hard to self teach the same but the right person might be able to do it. The value is in more than the credential.;jkcbefb;4gc51;534u2d0r
If you use 3 or 4 years of time to study and push yourself outwith class time it can be great. If you just do the minimums to pass it won't be great.;jkcci56;bbe51;534u2d0r
Career wise some to many top end jobs will not be available without a 4 year degree.;jkcflaa;5cmwrj0i;534u2d0r
It depends on the program. I'd say the best thing you can learn in college is how to learn new tech quickly. It gives you the foundation to ask the right questions and pick up new things. Unless you graduated recently a big chunk of things/languages you studied in college may be obsolete but the core concepts are still relevant. IT requires being a sponge/being able to pick up new things and college can make that easier depending on the school/instructor. Even the lamest classes I had in dead languages like VB taught me something.;jkch17p;h4xz1;534u2d0r
I can tell who didn‚Äôt go to college for cs pretty quickly. I wouldn‚Äôt trade what I learned at university for even a second and I majorly prefer working with people who studied cs in college.;jkci761;559i2usn;534u2d0r
I went to a top 10 school in computer science and it didn't teach me anything I couldn't learn on the outside;jkcigm3;afc6dfz2;534u2d0r
"A ton. Folks without degrees hit the ceiling very fast as they lack an understanding of theories are inflexible and operate within certain boundaries. SWE is not only ""programming"".";jkclc2t;9isthxun;534u2d0r
"> But does college teach you any significant information regarding software engineering for exampleGood ones do yes. Basic design patterns trivial ds & alg databases and SDLC concepts should be covered by the time most people finish undergrad and that stuff becomes relevant Day 0 of most people's first job. You're probably not writing a selection sort on Day 0 but a good understanding of control loops is absolutely relevant. Probably not implementing a red-black tree but understanding when to use something like a map versus a hashmap versus a linked list matters -- regardless of the particular language most of them have common data structures that make more/less sense in particular contexts. Understanding design patterns data structures algorithmic structure -- what a particular approach's strengths/weaknesses are -- matters. Both for maintainability purposes and for performance/efficiency purposes.My experience across a couple thousand of software engineering interviews and managing a few hundred ICs over the years is there's a noticeable difference in terms of quality of work between individuals who have a solid grasp on CS fundamentals and those who stopped at developing a minimal understanding of a specific stack via self-teaching or bootcamps. And most people are not particularly gifted at self-teaching themselves to an equivalent level of mastery offered by colleges/universities on any given topic. If most people were good at that colleges/universities simply would cease to exist. They definitely wouldn't pull the CS undergrad enrollment numbers they currently do -- there's heaps and heaps of very good material online to teach yourself CS fundamentals.I've hired really talented self-taught individuals. They are absolutely the exception not the rule. I've interviewed way more self-taught individuals experiencing wild levels of Dunning-Kruger -- nah brah that 2 years you spent cobbling together Python scripts in your slow hours to help the BI team out does not make you ""really more of a software architect than a software engineer"". Also mute your fucking mic when you need to take a piss.";jkcn7ss;eyj9u;534u2d0r
I self taught my colleague I worked with at my previous job had a full CS degree tbh he had a lot more academic/theoretical knowledge in holes in my knowledge though I had more work experience and it ended up being hella useful.  If I would do it all over again or if I ever just feel like I have all the time and money in the world I would go back for a degree since it is in fact useful.But that said self learning is great if you enjoy going at your own pace and that pace is faster than the traditional way.;jkcnn4r;ulr0i1k6;534u2d0r
The most important thing I learned was how to learn.  Maybe I could have done it on my own but it would have taken much much longer for me to achieve anything.;jkcnrj9;4i8hq;534u2d0r
I've been a senior dev for years and really all CS degrees do is give you common lingo to talk to the business folks.  The business folks are out of touch with reality though;jkco2kd;bysc2z9a;534u2d0r
Getting jobs will also easier at the start also because of your bachelor‚Äôs  degree;jkcos7h;ylz1n;534u2d0r
Nope. I've literally learnt everything myself. I've seen people get hired without degrees. Wish I'd  done an apprenticeship somewhere instead.;jkcrgec;5t6p3p5;534u2d0r
You've asked 2 different questions here. CS != Software engineering.To answer the question in the title yes of course a CS degree will help you improve at CS. To answer the question in the description yes you learn large parts if software engineering in a CS degree but there will of course be gaps. However that doesn't mean you have to fill all those gaps before you get a job. Companies know they're getting a junior and expect that you've got a lot to learn.It frustrates me that people assume employers know nothing. Big companies are spending millions on getting recruitment right so don't you think they'd stop looking for people with CS degrees if they were turning up knowing nothing?;jkcrz5f;v7wdg;534u2d0r
My sweet summer child. A CS degree is still your ticket into the industry an agreed upon and acknowledged stamp of approval;jkcskvf;a1ltq7d;534u2d0r
Yes its very helpful. That said my CS teachers were very lackluster most of my CS was learned from my EE professors. So for me college is what you make it.;jkctpqx;5wnt9yu6;534u2d0r
Helps but not for the reasons most think.  You typically only  4 semesters (last two years) coding first two years are typically  your prerequisites (English Calcs etc.).However just collaborating with peers and having key resources at your disposal can save you a ton of time.  Sometimes you may never figure it out on your own and just skip something.  If you just want to learn CS on your own for fun and never turn it into a career then you can definitely learn it on your own.  However college is very useful for making connections that you can leverage after graduation.;jkcucwe;acgat;534u2d0r
Computer science coding and software engineering are different from each other;jkcun4x;2fim9xx9;534u2d0r
This might be a bit controversial but anymore I think it really depends on YOU and how much effort you put in. I graduated in 2020 and honestly there were times in college where I put in so little effort that I felt like I should have failed courses‚Ä¶ but I didn‚Äôt. College feels very transactional now (you pay the bill you mostly get the degree) which means the onus is on you to drive your education. Of course that is somewhat dependent on the program/department you‚Äôre in and how rigorous the curriculum is. But if it‚Äôs anything like the average state school I went to you may walk out with a degree but that does not necessarily mean you have learned much (in my opinion). It is nice to have the structure of information and learning progression laid out for you and having the resources available to learn as much as you can but you must work hard and put them to use. I regret being as lazy as I was at points because I kinda feel like I robbed myself. Overall I‚Äôm glad I went and I still recommend studying CS especially over bootcampEdit: I want to clarify that you‚Äôve always had to work hard in college if you want to learn but it used to be that you HAD to work hard to get degree. I don‚Äôt necessarily find that true today;jkcuo8f;jia2udcn;534u2d0r
The best thing about college is you learn how much there is you didn‚Äôt know existed.;jkcvmgy;3ysaf;534u2d0r
Internships that you should do during college certainly do help. They give you bite sized problems and treat you with kid gloves which I liked. College also teaches you basics that you might not otherwise learn like algorithms and theory which are also important but many people overlook!;jkcw14x;tr9rs;534u2d0r
Yes a LOT.Although I was in a minority of people that took it seriously and didn‚Äôt cheat under any circumstances. I‚Äôm in a much better job/career path than the people who didn‚Äôt care and didn‚Äôt apply themselves;jkcwsi4;7qwvuymx;534u2d0r
Yes a college degree helps a lot. It shows a much higher likelihood of knowing fundamentals. I will give you my experience of working with people and interviewing people over 10 years. College degree candidates on average do by far better than self taught and boot campers and by a very healthy margin. You can read about the self taught and boom campers who made it big all day wrong. You need to know those are the exceptions not the norm. Do not get suckered by confirmation bias.  End of the day those are the ones who got the chance and made it pass the first few years. Most never make it and don‚Äôt get the chance. I am sticking to the fact that college degree at candidates in the first few years are just better on average. We have limited interview slots and limited time to interview.  You fill up those slots with the people who you have the best chance of finding a good person in. Sorry numbers don‚Äôt lie you have to go threw a lot fewer college degree people over self taught to find someone.;jkcxjrz;9masv;534u2d0r
For me a lot. I didn't go to high school and definitely needed the math that I learned. It taught me abstract thinking and breaking problems down into their smallest pieces. The computer science foundational classes were invaluable for me. I'm not saying you can't learn these things outside of those classes it's just easier for me to follow a defined curriculum where I have a teacher assign me things and classmates to work on them with. I have zero regrets about my degree;jkcxo91;ufc4l;534u2d0r
CS gives you foundational knowledge. Important but not critical. Data structures objects libraries &c - are all table stakes. Knowledge of how to work with others (in a team) is more important.But remember that big semester project of a couple of thousand lines that you wrote...  As a professional programmer I've written seventeen hundred lines in a weekend.In CS you learn very little about how to work within an existing code base as a professional that is 99.44% of your job.;jkcxvfj;17ignu;534u2d0r
I have my finals in 36 hours in the last 12 hours I have been reading taking notes and generally just freaking out. you can't replicate this with Code academy.;jkcyj2a;76f62e7m;534u2d0r
Some things to consider while a degree in this field isn't absolutely necessary some employers will not promote at some point in the chain without a degree. Also while I think people over estimate degree I think the learning environment matters way more. I love more about hard coding in my high school web dev classes because I had a really amazing teacher for years. Alot of my professors in college were well not as great not terrible but not great. Some would argue but in college your learning on your own which imao defeats the whole purpose of it at that point. Not to mention the first two years are all fluff classes and depending on your high school experience you should've learn most of that material anyways. I recommend acceleraceating/community College the first two years and than your local university to finish out. It might not be FAANG (though this sub forgets that there a whole world outside of FAANG) but you be in most of the country.;jkd1yn2;qg8xlt1;534u2d0r
Honestly I think it helps most with learning industry standards and terms.I had taken programming courses online and could develop before CS school. What CS school taught were concepts as Normalization Multithreading Inheritance Memory Utilization Encapsulation Abstraction and Polymorphism.In every tech interview I‚Äôve had in the past 5 years I was asked about these concepts in addition to a coding challenge. So while I don‚Äôt think CS school is necessary to create basic programs the concepts it teaches are necessary to get a job and get promoted (no one will become a senior programmer without knowing and utilizing the above terms).;jkd2iel;4fqjp8r3f;534u2d0r
To add on to this if you're self learning there's no one to check your work. So if you're making a project and are having a tough time with a feature you can just decide not to implement it or leave it a buggy mess and not get any feedback on it. Whereas in college you're at least going to get a bad grade which is closer to the real world because somebody will eventually find your bug.You also inherently learn less stuff by trying to do it all yourself. People rag on theory as unnecessary but they end up looking at leetcode tutorials for patterns I already learned in college. Or they don't see how learning theory makes you a better developer because you're approaching problems in a different way and using different parts of your brain. System design is also technically a theoretical topic so you'll need to learn it eventually;jkcovoz;do8xl;fdxl8
If you‚Äôre self-teaching you shouldn‚Äôt learn all the same material as a degree. It‚Äôs a waste of your time.Learn the basics (1st and 2nd year stuff) build things then try to get a job.;jkcdgfi;nu3oo;fdxl8
I went to community college. Not for CS for Multimedia (this was in 97). I took a few college courses on programming though. For the most part I'm self taught. I learned on the job (as a dev) and in whatever time I had outside of work. I managed to get a programming apprenticeship before I completed my degree. I've had a pretty long successful career. All of that said I absolutely missed critical areas of CS with this path. For a very focused career in CS learning DSA C and systems programming is pretty important. It's also become important for LeetCode and interviewing.I would say really taking time with a great CS program is probably the best path forward for a CS centric career path. I feel it becomes a little less important if you drift out of dev/data science/etc. Like more towards SE management marketing etc. The CS degree and deeper CS knowledge typically becomes less useful. Source: self taught dev with quite a bit of hindsight;jkc471d;930pgc1e;jtcfd5xj
Agreed: source was a dropout in a different degree program who learned in the job. I learned quickly how to get stuff basically working but learning how to do things in a way that is performant and maintainable took allot longer;jkcz6vk;12c6jl;jtcfd5xj
Is Texas a&m considered a good college for cs?;jkbx2r8;534u2d0r;74pdx
I‚Äôm curious how you‚Äôre interpreting ‚Äúsignificant information regarding software engineering‚Äù because from my perspective they absolutely do not teach that.If they did people would graduate and have the skills of a mid level or senior dev.;jkce3v8;nu3oo;74pdx
It‚Äôs funny you say that in my head I immediately thought of this video. https://youtu.be/4SiFgB1lGxw;jkcqfki;bzztsoi0;74pdx
Worthless after 3-5 years of work experience??College knowledge/degree would open a gate for those 3-5 years of experience;jkc3it9;3untfvz8;2jvyhe6o
Problem with the self learn route for me personally is that I feel less motivated to learn or maybe im just more distracted. Whereas when I‚Äôm in school learning this I‚Äôm focused on the material and I actually try to understand it so believe I‚Äôve college would be helpful as long as the material taught there is beneficial  since I would be way more focused on learning;jkbxb35;534u2d0r;2jvyhe6o
My degree has not been worthless to me after getting experience. It's more than just a piece of paper to get a job;jkcxzns;ufc4l;2jvyhe6o
That last anecdote sounds exceptional. As in I wouldn't expect anyone self taught or not to do that.;jkd240h;55r6l4bz;21bp2h5d
>at a decent university.>Feel like I didn‚Äôt learn shitNot a decent university then;jkcydsv;ufc4l;jok7l
>I definitely remember there being a lot more pro-boot-camp and pro-self-teaching comments and a lot more anti-degree comments but currently most comments seem pretty definitively in the pro-degree campThe reason for this is that people learned and changed their mind. As time went on and boot camps became more ubiquitous and the whole learned to code trend started boot camp started turning out poor and poor candidates and whereas normally people who would do self teaching would be motivated by Passion they started to be motivated by money and Tick-Tock influencers and all that crap. That has definitely changed people's minds;jkcynj4;ufc4l;6ixccf4r
I think that foundation is a huge plus.  Cause you never know how the market will shift.;jkco4qn;4i8hq;9t6ja
Do you have any degree or college experience?;jkc5qlt;bz2nt;8830fb6d
No one‚Äôs teaching themselves discrete math or OS in C on their own;jkcmznv;edsn0tfm;jwl54ow8
So untrue.;jkcmoee;9drhi6zn;n32aqqy5
This is completely false.  Humans have the ability to still learn new things past their mid-twenties.  There are thousands of people who didn't even start going to school for CS until later in life and are very successful (and skilled) programmers.  It's all about the individual and their motivation / ability to learn new things.;jkcsnbz;25ncvt6y;n32aqqy5
Yes this exactly. My degree taught me to think more like a scientist. The practical applications I learned through hands on experience at work/school projects. The theory portion is so fundamental I didn't see value in it back then but I do now.;jkcykn5;7g8p0;do8xl
Just wanna add to this too that group work and group projects from university/college are also kinda important because it's a common interview question to ask about working with a team and how you handled certain roles/scenarios in that environment;jkd2shv;4ep2yvu6;do8xl
Wow.  This is a rare moment for me to read about another multimedia grad except I did courses around 2000ish in college.  Crazy how much has changed since those days.;jkcgskz;2fvvnrfi;930pgc1e
Why is he getting downvoted?;jkclcwy;36doz94j;534u2d0r
While I don‚Äôt like Texas A&M for a lot of other different reasons and will poke fun at aggies it is a good school.;jkcmrgf;9masv;534u2d0r
Careful. They have this thing called ETAM where everyone does general engineering classes first year. After that you apply to the computer science major. If you don't get above a 3.75 GPA you're basically fucked. I had to transfer out because of this. A lot of those engineering credits don't transfer either. It was a very good campus and classes were decent though.;jkcw8ii;rmkjfq3j;534u2d0r
I'm sure it's a good program but it isn't something they're specifically known for. I wouldn't expect to get any special recognition just for having graduated from their program as opposed to another though they do have a pretty tight-knit alumni group.When you're looking at programs consider the cost of attendance carefully. It's a big investment and for the most part employers won't care much which school you went to. I don't know about the cost of their CS program specifically but A&M is significantly more expensive than many of the alternatives. TSU UNT UH SHSU and Lamar all have lower tuition. I work with people who spent 3 or 4 times as much getting their education as I did and we still get paid the same.;jkcs3o7;gw1bl;534u2d0r
"Not sure why you‚Äôre being downvoted unless you‚Äôre getting a ton of people who think you should go to MIT or you‚Äôre a failure. To answer your original question I‚Äôve personally found college opens doors that wouldn‚Äôt have been there without the degree and I personally only did a CS minor in a no-name school. For better or worse there are still a lot of hiring managers who won‚Äôt give you a look without it. Regardless of where the degree comes from. The other thing about a four year degree is the opportunity to be exposed to ideas outside of why you grew up with learn more about yourself and to form relationships you wouldn‚Äôt otherwise have had. Especially true if you live on campus away from home.  Sure it isn‚Äôt cheap and it takes four years but the money and the time are drops in the bucket compared to the rest of your working life.  For me the intangible benefits alone outweighed the costs. I‚Äôm sure A&M‚Äôs program is fine though I don‚Äôt know a ton about it.  In Texas the two public universities that will probably carry a bit more prestige will be UT: Dallas and Texas Tech. Though for Tech it means living in Lubbock god help you. ;) I would encourage you  to do what makes you happy.";jkcmitj;5nfwe;534u2d0r
no you go to m&a to learn how to raise chickens and fertilize the lands while being part of a cult. :D;jkcq8df;8fdrv1;534u2d0r
Didn't go there but should be good enough. I went to a worse/smaller college in Texas and feel like I learned a lot.;jkcqo8g;lltjpdxf;534u2d0r
Tagging on that you may want to consider community college to knock out some general credits before transferring to a more expensive college.;jkcvrh1;bbmjube9;534u2d0r
Absolutely. The C++ creator used to teach there actually. Also they have a great campus culture and alumni network.;jkcwr1v;vumnpz24;534u2d0r
I‚Äôve worked with a lot of people from a lot of backgrounds. Hands down the people with degrees especially but not necessarily in CS have always been multiple factors better than self-taught and boot camp people. College taught people think about code quality design efficiency etc‚Ä¶ more often than others.I‚Äôve also noticed that people with degrees tend to actually enjoy the job and that really shows in their velocity quality of work effort they put in and in general how much they care.But obviously my experience is anecdotal;jkc789j;604s2;3untfvz8
Your knowledge stay but no one will care about your degree after 3-5 years of work experience. A degree from Harvard or local school makes no difference.;jkc3lgj;2jvyhe6o;3untfvz8
I would say self learning path is for a self motivated person with a lot of free time. I have a BS in CS and studying a MS in CS. I would say university only provides me good foundation. I still self-learn as much as any self learner to keep up my tech stacks.For motivation I believe if you really want to do something you can do it without forcing yourself. You gotta like coding with passion in order to stay motivated.;jkby9h0;2jvyhe6o;534u2d0r
Yes college is helpful if the material is beneficial that is true.;jkc5p4s;qre5q;534u2d0r
Also if you do the calculus and physics it opens many other degree options.;jkcyjul;vumnpz24;534u2d0r
Yeah that makes more sense lol;jkcyshx;6ixccf4r;ufc4l
The individual people stayed the same but the bootcamp crowd saw an influx of noobs. Tragedy of the commons strikes again.;jkd2nlo;55r6l4bz;ufc4l
It's a plus but consider the opportunity cost. Why learn theory because the market might shift when you could be directly learning what you know you'll use for internship/application/job? Right now college teaches 100% theory and you have to spend your own time self learning. I think it should be 50/50.;jkcpulu;9t6ja;4i8hq
what kind of an argument ? if u just study that stuff for college u will forget them. and who says no one I was teaching myself computer arch and os and reading the intel manual when I was in highschool.;jkcpoj4;jwl54ow8;edsn0tfm
I'm just a few years ahead of you. Yes it's completely mind bending to have watched and contributed to the evolution of the modern Internet. Definitely a lack of respect for the webs history tho and for  the people who put down the tracks and plumbing. Kind of a shame really.;jkcyqk3;930pgc1e;2fvvnrfi
That alumni group is good. I will say I have found universities more are about getting your first job. I know A&M is going to be a lot easier to find something out of than the other schools you listed. Mostly because A&M career fair and companies that it brings to the school to recruit from it are just better and larger in number. I got my CS degree from UHCL (University of Houston- Clear Lake) and while it was cheaper getting a job out of it was harder as the school brought less companies to recruit from it and I used my connections to Texas Tech career center from my bachelor to land my first CS job. So never underestimate the connections the bigger schools get you just in starting out.  It makes that first job just easier. 10 years later it does not matter as much getting new jobs but that first one it does.;jkcyb1m;9masv;gw1bl
Texas Tech is not more prestigious I think you may have meant UT Austin.;jkct8s3;m9exu;5nfwe
This sounds very much like there is a large confounding factor here.University filters for a specific type of person. It‚Äôs not surprising that people who didn‚Äôt get a degree don‚Äôt tend to exhibit the same traits.;jkcdor5;nu3oo;604s2
How much does the cs degree help in interviews that involve leetcode?  I don't have a cs background and always have trouble when asked to solve these problems.;jkchilk;2fvvnrfi;604s2
That's just untrue;jkcy894;ufc4l;2jvyhe6o
Like in high school or college since I‚Äôm planning on taking them soon in Hs;jkd04ko;534u2d0r;vumnpz24
The market will 100% shift while you are working.  There is no might to it.  If you think otherwise then you are going to have a painful career.;jkcqrs2;4i8hq;9t6ja
That's a good point. Landing your first gig can be difficult and having any advantage can make a huge difference. I do wonder how much the recent increase in popularity of virtual career fairs has changed this. Companies can now spend a lot less for university recruiting. I'd imagine there are more companies engaging in these types of events than before and it's probably possible for employers with much smaller talent acquisition budgets to participate.;jkd0e0n;gw1bl;9masv
I completely agree with you on the alumni part. I was encouraged by one of my mentor to pursue MBA from A&M concentrate on management since I already been doing dev (I mentioned to my mentor I‚Äôd love to be manager down the road). I had a talk with them and they brag so much about their alumni network and how big of a connection they can offer. Other than that they said their career service is for life (this is only true for MBA idk about others) so in 10 years if I want to change career/ new job I‚Äôd still able to go to their career fair and whatever they offer. Services like these should be a good things to consider when it comes to comparing what colleges one should go to as well not just education alone;jkd18mz;k37cqst5;9masv
CS degrees teach you algorithms data structures and time complexity.Not just what they are and how to use them but how they work and the theory behind them.There is a method to calculate the time complexity of any program or algorithm The issue is that when you‚Äôre self learning the measure of success is if it works or not.With industry that‚Äôs not enough.The thing is you can learn these things. Pick up any cs textbook and it will teach you. The issue is that a lot of people don‚Äôt know that they need to know these things or even that these things exist;jkcspsq;ksdo5;2fvvnrfi
I am willing to bet Texas A&M career center is a lot likes Texas Techs in that it is life time access to any former student (technically any former student with at least 12 credit hours). The career fair usefulness I think drops rapidly as they don‚Äôt so much send companies looking for experienced people but the career center access and network is great. This is a far cry from UHCL career center which was a joke. They require you to pay some money for yearly access to their services.  I said F that and just reach out to TTU career center for my resume review and help.  I also know UofH does not grant access to their system as good for UHCL students which is stupid.;jkd21bu;9masv;k37cqst5
"> The issue is that a lot of people don‚Äôt know that they need to know these things or even that these things existThis is the big thing college can give you that almost no amount of self-teaching can. I was self-taught for years and years before I went to college for CS. I thought I could ""program anything"" and really I could without the degree. But after getting the degree I realized how amateurish everything I had ever written really was. That old code may have mostly worked but I would have been laughed out of git during a PR.Decades later everything I learned in college is still useful information. I've learned a ton more since then but that foundation was like a launch pad without which I would probably still be writing terrible code.";jkcuoud;geutjqbw;ksdo5
I'm looking for jobs in defense right now and it seems like listings are way down (for obvious reasons) but interviews are also harder to get as well. Is anyone else having this experience? It was always the case that the interview was hard to get but if you got one the job was basically yours. But rn seems especially harder...;13iltng;5msgipjb;
depends on level. honestly seems like senior jobs in every sector are still abundant(seniors always are in demand). juniors are def on the low end right now even in defense. everyone's just playing the wait and see game right now;jkahycm;lf1i5xev;5msgipjb
Competition + debt ceiling issues could be a reason defense contractors are being more conservative with hiring;jkakqce;8y9kaxy;5msgipjb
My company in defense is struggling to get enough applicants for our entry level positions. DM me for details. I'd also be happy to review your resume.;jkau8zk;chpxl;5msgipjb
I have recruiters up my ass daily. I already work in the sector though.;jkalgsj;v4tgot;5msgipjb
Just apply lol. Clearances is something you can get. If they like you they'll wait.;jkb9h1s;mrlmy;5msgipjb
Nope just swapped jobs two months ago and they re-wrote the entire job ad to upgrade me to a L6 lol Haven't seen a downturn at all in defense jobs. I still have recruiters multiple times a day reaching out. For reference primarily a network engineer with cloud experience sysadmin duties RF/SATCOM experience and cloud certs;jkagou3;pq0ddv0c;5msgipjb
Things might be reaching an inflection point with the Debt Ceiling fight.I think the days of unrestricted Defense sector spend increases may be ending.So big D might be getting ready to pump the breaks a bit;jkbdbka;11wslt;5msgipjb
For those of you who are getting multiple recruiter pings a day do you have anything special in your resume/linkedin?I get a recruiter ping like once a week not much else. I wonder if I'm not setting up my linkedin profile correctly.edit: Forgot to mention I'm in defense in a big tech company.;jkas0b4;296yj0vz;5msgipjb
There are a lot of factors to consider. Canadian Naval spending seems to be up.;jkcylwx;9p7m12ip9;5msgipjb
I just looked it appears seniors are having a hard time;jkcdz82;if6lwllj;lf1i5xev
I'd totally believe the debt ceiling one. In 2011 I worked as an intern for a company that relied on a contract. Me and other people were furloughed in anticipation of a shutdown. The shutdown never happened. But it was enough to spook contractors into furloughing subcontractors.;jkaz5d5;1197az;8y9kaxy
Interested;jkbr6n4;4aviqbgn;8y9kaxy
Could I DM you too?;jkbummr;zvokghi;chpxl
What‚Äôs the best way to break into the sector if I don‚Äôt have a clearance? I‚Äôd definitely be able to obtain one.Also I have about 3 years of experience as an SWE. I remember straight out of college recruiters from Boeing and Raytheon would contact me every day but rn i don‚Äôt hear from any of those types;jkanqyh;5msgipjb;v4tgot
Where should I go to apply to these types of jobs;jkbuuz8;zvokghi;mrlmy
is it just junior-mid level software roles that are being cut then?;jkahqq7;5msgipjb;pq0ddv0c
Use clearancejobs and put your clearance level. You‚Äôll get swarmed;jkass5z;kaqp6;296yj0vz
My LinkedIn shows a specific skill set but I get hit for other things too. Maybe I‚Äôm slightly more active on there? I don‚Äôt know.;jkbdqoz;a04yaf9q;296yj0vz
How does one apply? Eg what are their recruitment strategies and where do they post ads?It's not a sector I'm familiar with at all.  Asking because Canadian.;jkd3ydv;1v1d;9p7m12ip9
Look at Defense contractor websites in October/November. The big boys hire year round but mid to small sized businesses live off the surge of funding at the end of September and scramble to fill all the labor categories they bid.;jkb7zqs;2he1gpaa;5msgipjb
Just DM to discuss;jkao2d3;v4tgot;5msgipjb
My speculation is that companies are spooked right now to hire in people without a clearance. There's been some push from Congress to lock down how many people are getting clearances after the Discord leaks. If clearances take longer to approve then the company has to support you through some non-cleared work which could rely on commercial sector which B2B is suffering right now due to tech industry woes.;jkay5wa;1197az;5msgipjb
You don't have a clearance so that's why it's tough. Try going through actual government jobs to get one.;jkarajj;kntxd;5msgipjb
Just go apply to through their website. Aim for any non work for home. You'll get hired if your confident and know what your talking about.;jkckysg;mrlmy;zvokghi
I couldn't say. I know I was in orientation with two jr/mid software developers very recently.;jkahucy;pq0ddv0c;5msgipjb
Yeah I don‚Äôt know of any cuts. I suspect you‚Äôve inferred that incorrectly (to put it bluntly but meant encouragingly);jkbdmb9;a04yaf9q;5msgipjb
How much do you earn/charge?;13i73ct;vjuio9m7;
New Grad hire and I make around 95k TC. I think I charge $185 an hour but obviously don‚Äôt make nearly that.;jk8kyiw;bb70svz;vjuio9m7
8 YOE 200k TCStarted in Helpdesk lead IT consultant now;jk92azr;5i4ml;vjuio9m7
Do you work for yourself LLC  or under a consulting company;jk8sbfh;i6q4d80;bb70svz
I‚Äôm at a pretty large firm;jk8vany;bb70svz;i6q4d80
They created a task on Workday and asked me to provide my SNN before or shortly after the first meeting with the recruiter. They said the purpose of this is to make sure that I am not already in their recruiting system. The recruiter‚Äôs linkedin seems legit and I applied directly on their website. Is this normal though?;13iyk1z;a8pidgki;
Say you don't feel comfortable and see how they respond.Are you sure they have workday?;jkcabxc;hi9rd;a8pidgki
If they are legit but use SSN as their unique identifier you prooobably don't wanna work there anyway. Or you know they're not legit;jkcc6yk;6e2xahi;a8pidgki
They're mining for personal info stay away.;jkcb4rg;1288jr;a8pidgki
Giving your SSN is not necessary or helpful for figuring out whether you're already in their system. Why can't they just look you up by name and number? How would they have gotten your SSN earlier to compare? Why do they need your SSN to put you in their recruiting system? Why are they communicating with you through workday before you even interview? I have a really common name and have interviewed with many large and smaller companies and I was never asked for my SSN until I already accepted an offer and needed to fill out a W-11.;jkchg66;9o3g2;a8pidgki
Never do this. Some random person now will know your ssn and on top of that you have no clue who else will. You only give your ssn when you get a job;jkciq48;afc6dfz2;a8pidgki
No;jkca97l;8k5auy2x;a8pidgki
I run recruiting and HR. Not in a million years will they ask you for this. Nobody except for the most Senior HR people compensation team and the background check vendor will have access to your SSN. It's a complete lie.;jkcs4bx;61bys;a8pidgki
I am a recruiter for a company that uses workday. No. Don‚Äôt give them your SSN. That is not needed until *after* signing an offer and beginning a background check;jkcpq7n;eclt0;a8pidgki
I've never given SSN until I had an offer and they needed to verify my eligibility to work in the US and/or do a background check. That's not a personal rule I've made but how the process typically works. Asking for an SSN ahead of an actual interview is sus. They might be legit and just kinda idiots. I have to wonder if they ask for it so casually do they also treat that info casually?;jkcpq4o;7s9qbgk00;a8pidgki
No way.;jkck9hg;1gw3ty7;a8pidgki
What sort of company is it? The response will be different depending on that. If it's a Fortune 500 company I wouldn't be worried.;jkchhou;6ttog;a8pidgki
You should say which company it is help others stay away from them.;jkcwoue;3f8o7oh3;a8pidgki
Yes this is normal. Just provide them any info people here are just paranoid.;jkcd5f5;bp16b1n;a8pidgki
Nope nope nope;jkcp5ol;4xk7pm5j;a8pidgki
Nope this is a scam.;jkcy53l;vtwt12d6;a8pidgki
Just make up some shit that you‚Äôve had your identity stolen before so you don‚Äôt want to give it out. Say you‚Äôll be happy to do so for a background check following an offer but that you‚Äôre extra precautious nowadays.;jkcz1at;eejo5;a8pidgki
Tbh at this point every SSN is leaked;jkd10qt;ix2zq2y7;a8pidgki
it could be legit but there has to be a better way;jkd1dr8;7zeqwgdt;a8pidgki
I have seen this for Bank of America app on Workday is a required field too. I was surprised big company like them asked for it (also applied for Chase Citi USBank and they did not ask). I did end up filing it out though.;jkd32dv;k37cqst5;a8pidgki
I was a recruiter from a company who has a client who did this. I don‚Äôt agree with the practice but I have seen it before and for exactly the reason you said;jkd4i35;1iih7949;a8pidgki
They do have my app on Workday!;jkccibt;a8pidgki;hi9rd
Yeah I don‚Äôt think they should ask for more than email phone and maybe home address. Workday generates a candidate ID as a unique ID they shouldn‚Äôt need to use an SSN.;jkcyw3m;136ryj;6e2xahi
It is super unusual for a company to ask you for your SSN before being hired and filling out paperwork. It's definitely suspicious.;jkcivie;cuyrgyy6;6ttog
Shouldn't they only be using the last four digits at most and not the whole number?;jkcgzk8;176qpd;bp16b1n
When someone uses your info to open credit cards in your name you will learn how dumb is to give some random person you SSN.;jkcmdhc;bvfns4t5;bp16b1n
or you just have no idea what you are talking about.No  This is not normal;jkctk58;3f4ayfx9;bp16b1n
This isn't even close to normal. What the fuck is wrong with you?;jkcy9ms;vtwt12d6;bp16b1n
Even that depending on your age(or at the very least when you were assigned your number) can be insecure. Knowing someone who was born before 2011‚Äôs place and date of birth plus the last 4 of their social can give you the whole thing.;jkcjn47;eet23370;176qpd
This happens a lot in my team. Every time I ask a question directly to a more senior engineer I try to give context of the problem what I have found and what I have tried and the problems that I'm facing.They always provide low-effort answers with a lot of ambiguity or don't answer at all and I feel very frustrated because I spent a lot of time making the question clear enough to get a helpful answer.Sometimes I think they just don't want to answer and say anything comes to their mind right away.Often they don't even bother turn on the mic when I ask something in a zoom meeting.How can I handle this situation? When I do this is because the repo I'm working on was literally created by him and he owns the  knowledge and didn't bother to create documentation for it.;13iticd;ldg07n4v;
As an alternate explanation than the ones already provided:It's not as simple as always giving a direct answer. In my yearly review I actually got told I should be less direct with juniors because it isn't helping them grow. Giving a link directly to the line of code you need to change is actually easier for me than giving a answer that just steers you in the correct direction. However that doesn't mean it is best for your growth.There is also the rare situation where it is the exact opposite. I also have no clue of the answer but it is something that is going to require relatively equivalent leg work from either of us to figure out. In this case I might as well let you figure it out but I'll often say as much when this is the case.;jkbou2k;b7id4g6;ldg07n4v
Can you provide an example of your question and their response? Hard to tell how ambiguous the response was. In general it isn‚Äôt good to give the answer flat out since you want the Jr to be the one to solve the problem. As a senior I am nearly stealing you towards the right direction.;jkbx03k;7krvtmha;ldg07n4v
As a senior architect myself one of two things are happening: 1. Your questions are hard. 2. Your questions are ambiguous and unclear. Either way it‚Äôs taking a lot of work from them to answer your questions. Make your questions easier to answer and you‚Äôll get better answers.;jkbms7j;sqw7g;ldg07n4v
You would be surprised by how much is unknown or difficult to answer. There's also a lot that seniors don't know and they don't want to appear dumb in front of the lead or other seniors.Really you need some regular 1:1 time so that you get to ask followups and hopefully the seniors can provide more detailed explanations. Try to get a weekly 1:1 with your lead or manager and a weekly or biweekly 1:1 with at least one other senior to try to get your questions answered.;jkbw0hx;dmwxln9w;ldg07n4v
Unspoken thoughts:* I answered this one for you yesterday - and twice last week.* I have answered this one for every newbie I have ever met* Seriously? Didn't you learn this at college?* Hey this is clearly Googleable - why not try that before asking me?* Can't you see that I am dealing with a crisis? Why ask at this precise moment?* I think that you asked Fred the same question a few minutes ago. Why ask me now? Which one of us don't you trust?* Who the f\*\*k are you? Are you even in my team?* Do you really need to ask me whilst I am eating my lunch?;jkc8os4;u3a0t5s3;ldg07n4v
"Yes. It runs the gambit. Replying with a vague question to your question that isn't even about what you're asking. Not replying.Passing it on to someone else. Who also is just guessing at an answer. Trying to explain something to you that you clearly already know based on your questioning and acting like they somehow gave you an answer. At which point you just have to back off because you can't drill into them too hard without being deemed ""confrontational.""Some people are just held together with duct tape and popsicle sticks making it day to day.";jkc9kub;ygj36;ldg07n4v
The answers being given really touch on the common dynamic with larger teams and orgs but there are a couple major standout points that really need to be addressed here:> Often they don't even bother turn on the mic when I ask something in a zoom meeting.That is just.... absurdly disrespectful> How can I handle this situation? When I do this is because the repo I'm working on was literally created by him and he owns the knowledge and didn't bother to create documentation for it.The beginning of your post is talking about your team and different seniors but in the end you say its one repo and one person.  If this is a situation where it's a small company where there's just one person who basically built everything then you're definitely likely to encounter a lot more domain resistance and pain that at a standard operation where the large size of a codebase necessitates a strong team dynamic.;jkburg7;74pdx;ldg07n4v
"I'm often a little vague to give the junior a chance to think of the answer.  My guidance really just pushes them down the right path without just giving the answer so that they go through the process and learn.Also try stuff out and ask follow up questions when you have them.  You could say ""hey I tried x but I'm not following how that fixes y"" or something.Do be careful not to abuse this though.  I have a coworker who can pretty much only get work done if you tell them exactly what to do and now no one wants to help them or even do code reviews.";jkcot92;d292e;ldg07n4v
This is relevant: how to be great at asking questions. https://medium.com/@gordon_zhu/how-to-be-great-at-asking-questions-e37be04d0603;jkcmn1x;9ua93wof;ldg07n4v
‚ÄúDid you search Jira?‚Äù;jkcmntu;jdxzg;ldg07n4v
"Depending on the importance of this piece of code. Is the code unit tested? As uncle bob would say the unit test is the documentation and if it‚Äôs not; be a boy/Girl Scout and leave the camp ground cleaner than when you first came(write some tests/create your own documentations). What this does is it creates value for your team that your manager can see. You are being proactive and it will also cause your senior to take action if the documentation is slightly incorrect which in turn will give you the answer you need and make you look good in front of your manager.";jkcppui;gwswp;ldg07n4v
Even if I'm genuinely trying to give an answer a lot of the time there's an asterisk attached because the answer could really go on forever due to multiple edge cases or how the system is designed. Making an assumption about how I think the library or function is implemented is a bad move so I'd just say to read the docs for it and test it out. The alternative is similar to needing to do X and finding an online question X' that's similar but for a different reason. The answer says to do Y instead even though Y is impossible on your version of whatever or it's disabled by security standards. The answer Y is very specific but ultimately helps you less than if the answer was a little vague told you how to do X or X' and let you judge for yourself whether that was a viable solutionEdit: look at a post a bit newer than this that asks the opposite problem where a senior gives a very verbose answer because they're actually trying to cover all the edge cases even though there are some simplifying assumptions;jkcq8dx;do8xl;ldg07n4v
Very often these questions are radioactive. Oh senior you know what problem the junior is having? Go walk them through it over the next few days without impacting your own deliverables.If you can‚Äôt get the support on your own let your manager know. They‚Äôll need to assign someone else to help or take it over.;jkcqzmi;cwiu3;ldg07n4v
Meh I guess mentoring isn't part of how they're being assessed at reviews. They sound like they're unmotivated to help either out of laziness or being under too much work. If you show your work and can talk through your problem and what you've tried then they should at least try to help or point you to someone who can. It's part of the role of a senior dev to mentor.Personally I love it when people come to me with questions about stuff I know. Especially when it prevents something stupid from getting merged in.;jkcr9ru;7s9qbgk00;ldg07n4v
Are you asking these questions by messaging?If so some people may prefer to get on a call because they can verbally express themselves better than writing down the answer.Personally I can express myself 100 times more clearly by writing an answer with diagrams and drawings.But I don't do so well with verbal communication as words don't come out quickly I take time to formulate my sentences/answer I tend to stutter a little because I can't get the right words to express my thoughts.However for some of those engineers they may prefer a call because they are just better in giving out the answer verbally. For some messaging may seem a waste of time as they have to type  wait for you to type and go back and forth. For them verbal communication is easier and more time efficient. Hence they may try to be quick with the answers when typing.I have just noticed that there are engineers who write great answers but are also good verbal communicators. I have also noticed those who don't give great written answers but are willing to verbally communicate it to me.And also some people are more comfortable with 1-1 communication than having a group meeting.People are hard because you got to figure out what they prefer. You could just straight up ask what they prefer (to write or to get on a 1-1 call).I have been fortunate I guess because the people I have talked to have been helpful and also willing to help me out whenever I had a question.;jkcrp88;2g62ff1g;ldg07n4v
"I have often ignored questions or left time in between answers because some juniors consider you a library that holds all the answers when sometimes they are perfectly capable of figuring things out themselves. It also didn't help that sometimes i would help out and I would be greeted with a reply along the lines of ""that doesn't make sense"" from someone who graduated few months prior.It's really not about senior/junior interaction but you should be mindful of people's time priorities and context. If you are doing that then maybe try bundling up your questions into a longer message instead of one question every 15min. It's less disruptive that way :)";jkcrz6e;2d8ac2dp;ldg07n4v
It depends...;jkcv87x;1g6jw6se;ldg07n4v
Yes.;jkcvy9d;55llp4vo;ldg07n4v
- You say you are asking over zoom. Is this in an appropriate time and context? Is this a time scheduled for you to be able to ask direct coding questions?- Did you ask over slack (or chat or teams) first? Giving them the opportunity to answer the questions asynchronously when they time so you are not interrupting their work. Sending people zoom links so you can ask questions is actively interrupting people and not making you any friends. - Are you sure that the context you are giving is relevant? I get asked questions (not just from JR‚Äôs) with a lot of unnecessary context and they frequently miss the actual relevant context entirely. That turns into me having to ask a bunch of questions to figure out what actually needs to be asked.- Are you asking the same questions repeatedly? I‚Äôm up front when I onboard juniors that we hired them for their potential so we know they are going to have questions. But don‚Äôt ask the same question 3 times The first time is free the second time I assume I didn‚Äôt explain it clearly the 3rd time shows me you aren‚Äôt listening. I‚Äôm not very nice the 3rd time.;jkd2ye6;phy6sll;ldg07n4v
I tell Junior devs a lot ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know but I‚Äôd start here‚Äù because really knowing where to even start IS the difference between Junior and Senior devs.;jkcsobm;93jse;b7id4g6
When I was a junior I felt that I ‚Äúgrew‚Äù more when other engineers just answered my questions being drip fed titbits of information and hints and things just made me feel demeaned and like I wasn‚Äôt really an equal and that I was still in this wierd constantly ongoing job interview process.As a result of being treated as an equal I felt vastly more motivated to learn and be able answer questions for myself in the future rather than having to just ask for help.;jkczh9i;3ylt54;b7id4g6
I'm a junior engineer so I don't think my questions are very hard.I put in the time before asking anything literally anything because I know how it feels to answer a low-effort question and make more questions to answer the original.So yeah maybe it takes a lot of time to answer those questions.;jkbopn8;ldg07n4v;sqw7g
"Exactly. They may know the overall architecture but you can't expect the senior engineer to remember the exact function to change all the time. Even if he wrote the codebase himself. Most of the time they will reply something like: ""Check module A it should interact with B through connector C"". What happens is that most of the time the junior spends an hour looking through those 3 components and figures it out eventually.";jkcs1p7;gzkeycon;dmwxln9w
I think one of my great assets throughout my career has been my willingness to ask what my brain tells me might be stupid questions.  I'd say maybe 1 in 5 ends up being a legit dumb question but very often it's something either no one has considered or that other people are wondering and are self censoring to not ask.;jkd2l1k;12c6jl;dmwxln9w
Why not turn them into spoken thoughts and communicate with your teammates;jkcqtf8;edsn0tfm;u3a0t5s3
This +1;jkcrdog;2d8ac2dp;u3a0t5s3
That is very precise;jkctjjt;5hyixrej;u3a0t5s3
"My favorite is being asked a question spending time formulating an answer that is concise and even jumping on a call only to be told: ""That's wrong it should work like this. Why isn't it?""";jkcxq5z;21rvnvy5;2d8ac2dp
Google.com your welcome.;jkcw6sz;kqb9a;93jse
"Yeah I'll say ""I'd have to look that up. Here's a link to the documentation."" And when I say documentation it's usually a link to the exact place you'd find the answer not the project's homepage. I'll tell you exactly where to go but I'm not reading it for you.";jkczbxl;xkhh9x7;93jse
Could also be that you dont realize there is complexity in those questions and so think they are easy. Again hard to say anything without knowing the questions but that also happens with some engineers;jkbr74c;cjldd;ldg07n4v
Any time I encounter a ‚Äúsimple clear‚Äù problem I add a day or two of work for nearly guaranteed senior and lead involvement plus the routine MR debates about said ‚Äúvery straightforward totally junior-solvable‚Äù problem.

The kids ChatGPT it these days. Still doesn‚Äôt help if you don‚Äôt know what to ask!;jkcyb6r;93jse;kqb9a
It's probably domain specific;jkczq9x;a9eat;47rc3
None of these are better off left unsaid and take one sentence to get across in a professional manner. ‚ÄúHey I‚Äôm eating right now I‚Äôll get back to you after.‚Äù Is that hard? Engineers need to get better at communicating to just not respond at all is bad for a lot of reasons. Trust morale everyone‚Äôs view of the person not saying anything is that they‚Äôre a bad communicator or hard to work with. There are no benefits to lack of communication with teammates;jkcvqte;edsn0tfm;dzmbmf4i
"Or more ""How"" to ask. It is pretty easy to feed GPT a topic ask it to expand some key words and ask how that might fit into your current scenario.If you don't know what the problem is you probably don't have background information you don't even know you're missing. Once you have that you should be able to get towards asking the right questions.";jkczdvh;1277ds;93jse
I recommend not using this because ChatGPT will give you confident incorrect answers that will steer you down the wrong path and waste your time. I've spent hours trying to figure something out with chatgpt just to find out what it's attempting can't be donegoogle/stackoverflow are much better first resorts.;jkd5idm;kntxd;93jse
Yup. I‚Äôll reply to you after I‚Äôm done and just say sorry I was on lunch If I‚Äôm working on something else I‚Äôll tell them I‚Äôll reach back out‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you learn this college‚Äù‚Ä¶ maybe maybe not but they clearly don‚Äôt know now so no point in railing them for that. Juniors eventually stop being juniors I‚Äôll just point them to a source they can find it if I can. Sometimes you don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt know and it is indeed faster to ask a team member than figure out what it is you actually need once you‚Äôve done your due diligence to try to find out. Funny enough I bet if said junior took foreverrr to find an answer the more senior members will pull the ‚Äúnext time don‚Äôt wait so long‚Äù card but at the same time still be mad that the junior with no experience somehow didn‚Äôt think of what you did with your years of experience. All you do is produce an engineer who is not confident in anything If I know for sure what they‚Äôre asking me is in documentation somewhere I‚Äôll ask them to read the docs at least give them a ballpark what section it should beIf they put no effort in I‚Äôll still answer and append at the end some steps they can take to get better responses from their teammates. I haven‚Äôt had to give the effort tidbit more than once to any one person. Mentoring training and nurturing your lower level teammates is part of the job. If you don‚Äôt want that find a place that doesn‚Äôt hire juniors or has a much higher bar for what they consider a junior that‚Äôs good enough to work there.;jkd35bs;10fyj4l8;edsn0tfm
I'm days away from graduating college and had lined up a job where I can work from home. Just received an email that all new hires must work in person for the first year of employment. They have no office in my state and will not be paying for any relocation. I declined other job offers with higher pay because of the fact that I could work from home here. Has anyone been in this position? I feel screwed if I wanted to uproot my life I would never have worked for this company. I could have applied to companies in NYC and been making twice as much.;13imgsu;6an8sip1;

Call the other companies and ask if their offer still stands. Stop crying and start applying.;jkaqco0;ukeubsd5;6an8sip1
Did you make sure your offer letter stated 100% remote no ifs ands or buts before you signed?  If so then point to that and say that you will not be relocating because both parties agreed to a 100% remote position.I'm guessing they used language that could be interpreted as not 100% remote by a lawyer.  If so then you are SOL.  You can renege stating that you only wanted 100% remote work and look for a new job or accept they have altered the deal and pray the don't alter it any further.;jkaoya9;fb1k3;6an8sip1
Sorry to hear hope you get it sorted out. Let this be a lesson to anyone that remote isn‚Äôt permanent. Remote was a special case before the pandemic and most people work in office. Companies especially big corporations never had intentions to make it permanent. I am not sure if there is anything you can do unless your employment contract say anything. Just like benefits can change remote work is like a temporary benefit.;jkbgcrz;7krvtmha;6an8sip1
that sucks.  just don't relocate start looking for a new job now and assume they will fire you at some point.;jkbfowj;53bpbucj;6an8sip1
This is why we don't reneg the backups till you actually start employment;jkbvru2;rojjyvs;6an8sip1
"As if it isn't annoying enough that half the ""remote"" jobs say in the description that they require certain days in office when there is an option for the employer to mark ""hybrid"" (I get some job boards repost content from other sites but still it's annoying ).This though this is just sketchy red flags. Run!";jkcgrv8;m4hu1bsc;6an8sip1
"you're not going ""crawling back.""If they didn't burn bridges and were professional when they declined the offer the recruiter would love to sign up again.";jkb4o0u;acf5flys;ct2zfsl1
Maybe I'm naive but I would have thought there was some kind of employment rights in this country. Requiring someone to move to an entirely different state than the one they accepted the offer in seems like constructive dismissal.;jkakq2x;6an8sip1;ct2zfsl1
>Did you make sure your offer letter stated 100% remote no ifs ands or buts before you signed?  If so then point to that and say that you will not be relocating because both parties agreed to a 100% remote position.  >  >I'm guessing they used language that could be interpreted as not 100% remote by a lawyer.Even this doesn't particularly matter. They can let go of OP before they start for any reason and OP wouldn't be entitled to anything. Heck they could let go of OP after they started and it wouldn't mean anything. Sometimes if you did move and they let you go before your start date you can get something - depending on the local laws.But the offer letter is essentially meaningless. The employer is not obligated to stick to any of it. OP could start and they could change his title and pay in the first hour. It's all meaningless. There's no legal or lawyer options here.The only thing anyone is bound to is an employment contract (and that's almost always going to be in the employers favor.) An offer letter is not an employment contract. OP has not mentioned an employment contract.;jkaxmix;ewfnf3pd;fb1k3
It appears that they worded it ambiguously.;jkapaf1;6an8sip1;fb1k3
The company has a work anywhere policy still in effect for the majority of their employees. None of my team members will be in the office except the 1 other new grad.;jkbjegn;6an8sip1;7krvtmha
I didn't know that was a thing. I thought it was respectful to indicate that I had accepted another offer.;jkbvur1;6an8sip1;rojjyvs
If you haven't started yet it's not constructive dismissal. You should absolutely write a bad review on every review platform though.;jkalo1p;nmedtdpg;6an8sip1
> Maybe I'm naive but I would have thought there was some kind of employment rights in this countryHa>Requiring someone to move to an entirely different state than the one they accepted the offer in seems like constructive dismissal.What do you think the consequences of constructive dismissal are?;jkanr8e;328doggt;6an8sip1
lolWelcome to the real word. US is one of the worst countries when it comes to employees' rights. Unless your job offer specifies that it is remote and doesn't have a clause where the employer can change the location you can't do anything about it. I would recommend talking with them and asking them to work remotely for the first 2-3 months until you find a place to live in that new state and organize moving. In the meantime start applying for other jobs. If you get something better take it if not decide if you will move or quit.;jkasgl7;bvfns4t5;6an8sip1
You have the right to work at other companies with better policies.;jkauwq8;5mrydl08;6an8sip1
Employment rights yes. Employment rights that prevent either party from terminating the employment at any point no.;jkaqia4;ukeubsd5;6an8sip1
Does your offer letter mention location? Is it an unconditional job offer? I don‚Äôt know anything about US employment rights but I very much doubt your offer letter puts them into a legally binding contract to allow you to work for them remotely.Honestly why try to fight them on it anyway? Just say you can‚Äôt move and could only work remote for them if they say no to that just move on. You probably don‚Äôt want to start your first job with a fight they are clearly going to be a shit company to work for if they pulled a bait and switch anyway.;jkam6j7;ct2zfsl1;6an8sip1
Yep I had remote written on my offer letter and now I'm going to the office 3 times a week ü´† My company only considers a worker remote if they went through an approval process that goes up through several levels. Then they get a special distinction in their profile.;jkb6he4;hxe8k;ewfnf3pd
I never said they couldn't be fired on day 1 hour 1 if the company so pleases.  Nobody is disputing that.At least if the offer letter said 100% remote you can then tell the company that they change the deal and you won't sign any employment contract until it's written correctly.   They company is well within their right to tell OP to fuck off and that they changed it on purpose so suck it up.I'm at least trying to be helpful by trying to help OP navigate the situation.;jkazlhw;fb1k3;ewfnf3pd
I understand that.. all I am saying is that it could easily change. Of course good leaders will give enough warnings if something like remote/wfh is going be be phased out.;jkbkby6;7krvtmha;6an8sip1
These companies aren‚Äôt your friends man. It‚Äôs a dog eat dog world out there. Look after yourself mate;jkbwd6f;rojjyvs;6an8sip1
If I was laid off I would be entitled to at least 50% of salary in unemployment for 26 weeks so about $25k. It seems that's why many companies are changing their work from home policy anyways so they can layoff without having to pay severance.;jkapimj;6an8sip1;328doggt
even if it does have that clause there might not be much he could do.;jkbfyvi;53bpbucj;bvfns4t5
> Does your offer letter mention locationIt has my home address but doesn't mention remote work. > Honestly why try to fight them on it anyway?You say you're not from the US so I guess you aren't familiar with the way student loans work here. I'll have an $800 / month student loan payment starting soon so being unemployed isn't really an option. I need to sign a lease within the next month and would need to put that job down as income to get a decent place to live. Also with many tech companies doing layoffs the job market will be incredibly difficult. Most companies did their recruiting 10 months ago so I'm really behind the game if I'm going to find a new job. And chances are I'll need to move there too.> they are clearly going to be a shit company to work for if they pulled a bait and switch anywayThe HR has been pretty shitty but the actual manager and team (who I worked my internship with) was great.;jkana5q;6an8sip1;ct2zfsl1
Offer letters are not legally binding contracts so it wouldn‚Äôt matter.  Because an employer can legally change the terms of a job at any time an offer letter can say ‚Äúwfh‚Äù and the employer can legally change their mind the next day. What the OP would need is an actual bona fide employment contract (rare in the US) that guarantees WFH.  No employer is going to sign one of those.;jkcmz7w;6ewio734;ct2zfsl1
"Employers almost never put the work location in the employment contract for this reason or have a clause saying they can modify the work location at any time. I'd be very surprised if OP gets this in an employment contract.OP's time is probably better spent skipping to the ""fuck off"" part.";jkazunv;ewfnf3pd;fb1k3
What are you suggesting? That I should have accepted multiple offers until the one I wanted starts? Or just not say no to the others?;jkby61g;6an8sip1;rojjyvs
Unemployment insurance is not severance completely different.You have to pay into UI for a while before you can claim UI benefits. It‚Äôs not 50% of salary there are limits.;jkavcpk;5mrydl08;6an8sip1
>If I was laid off I would be entitled to at least 50% of salary in unemployment for 26 weeks so about $25k.You were making $100k while still in school? Good for you.>so they can layoff without having to pay severance.They don't have to pay severance anyway.;jkaqynl;328doggt;6an8sip1
I see that is really tough. If you have a relationship with the team and did an internship with them then that is different. Get in touch with the manager and let them know about your situation they will probably be more helpful than HR ever will be and might have some discretion.Best of luck;jkaty8y;ct2zfsl1;6an8sip1

A lot of people tend to focus on their technical stack when they are considering new jobs but have any of you built a niche with building specific types of products?Product Domains like:- Advertising Platforms - Search algorithms- API development/orchestration - Video or Music Streaming- Recommendation Algorithms (any type) - Geolocation and shortest path algo (ride share) - OS Development Ect. Is there an advantage to sticking to a domain in your opinion or is it better to stay general?;13icfsn;7zu4s33m;
Be a good generalist like if you can't do Linux but just Python notebook coding you are limited. Let your interests grow organically and learn the ins and outs of a particular specialty through practice. Pick up new skills often as you are capable but don't settle for surface understanding. Become a master of your stack.;jk94207;mnd4j;7zu4s33m
There's many correct paths to success.As someone who has switched product domains in each job that I've taken ... (aviation embedded > Banking > Insurance > OS Development > Food/Franchise) learning a domain is certainly a good thing to do while in a job.For my career I don't foresee myself specializing in a domain unless I'm given a very lucrative incentive to. However I've had friends specialize and they're doing quite well for themselves.;jk9ftp0;isznhznw;7zu4s33m
I know a hippie-ish guy who was really into music helped organize an annual local outdoor music festival and his specialty was C++ and audio for 25+ years.He worked with the same niche audio editing startup off and on for 15 years.  He wrote his own audio editing program which he never finished.  He worked with the same 6-10 audio SWEs at that startup that paid poorly and was dying for years.  Those guys would always end up back at that startup.He kept saying ‚ÄúI really feel that I need to learn at least a little webdev so I can get a better job.‚Äù  He eventually went to the G and got paid a lot of money to work on the audio of some game.  Last I heard he felt more secure because of the G money and thought that he might try to get a job at F.  But he still mentioned learning a bit of webdev.For him it was a labor of love but he always felt job insecurity.;jkaqd0p;q40ylesy;7zu4s33m

For me the best quality is being able to take a problem and break it down into it's basic components until even a child could understand it.You can make it pretty far if you can do that since at its core all programming is hooking together really simple operations.

Maybe it's a good time to focus on finding excitement in your own life outside of work? Even if it's just picking up a small hobby.

I always have this dreadful feeling that I will be caught red handed that I actually don't know anything. I am a front end dev and have worked with PHP in the past and I had to lie in my CV that I have 2 years worth of experience in react while I had none to get the job in which I am working rn. I am working here for almost 1 and a half year now and considered for heavy lifting projects. But a few months ago my sister's company had a job opening. I gave the interview I passed the first but bombed the second one. I didn't have answer to things I already knew and used. Like what's a stateless and stateful component in react. Ever since I have felt like I am not good enough and probably will be caught for something very basic and stupid and my whole credibility will be questioned for it. Is this normal? Does anyone else feels that way? Did you guys ever lie about your experience as well??;13iw7k7;8svbt3i97;
Ofc you have to lie as recruiters and hr rewards liars by giving them interviews instead of those that are honest and truthful. It is normal to lie to get a job but I doubt people lie once they get more experience. It makes no sense at that point. For junior/entry level roles it's in the name - they're there to teach you or to give you a foot in the door.;jkcbdz7;k7ksnrsi;8svbt3i97
There is a thing called Impostor Syndrome where people doubt there capabilities but in truth they do possess the knowledge. This is fairly common among developers even among those working at big tech companies like Google. I am not sure what you are going through is impostor syndrome or not. My only suggestion would be to start taking genuine honest interest in whatever work you do. Whenever you build something or use a technology constantly ask yourself about why you are doing it in that particular way. Google and ChatGPT are your friends here you can ask anything to them without feeling judged. It will take some time maybe few months or an year but slowly you will start understanding the finer details of your work and will soon become an expert. This will not only help with your confidence but will also help you crack interviews of other jobs.;jkc0f19;3ugwhbvs;8svbt3i97
Interviewing is not the same as being good at your job it is a skill so I would recommend going on a few more interviews to get a feeling for what they'll ask in an interview and how to respond to questions (I've probably interviewed with over 100 companies and now I can breeze through everything except the core competence questions which is basically where you want to be because those are the questions that shows you where you are and what you should be improving on);jkcrgz2;23bi1gsr;8svbt3i97
I got an AS in computer programming and web development a few years ago and have been a full stack web dev for four years. Transferred to a university after I graduated but had to drop out because of family stuff and I couldn't deal with that work 40 hours a week and take classes. I've sent out probably like 200 applications and have only been contacted back by maybe 5.Granted I'm only looking at remote positions which I know are a lot more competitive but I just thought my experience would've been at least as attractive as a bachelor's degree in CS and gotten me a few more nibbles. I also know that it could be other factors that make my applications not stand out but I'm convinced that my AS instead of a BA/BS is at least a factor at play.;13ivvo3;9iy90bpze;
Probably never if you want the honest answer. Sure you could have 20 years of experience and may be way better at programming than someone with a degree but when job searching companies basically can filter out candidates without degrees with a single click. I would say the exceptions to this would be if your experience is at a top notch firm or if you have created a popular app or something. It sucks but everyone is basically just one data point to these companies and if you can‚Äôt check that box and someone else can you may not get the opportunity. That being said it‚Äôs not impossible and you should have less trouble finding jobs the more experience you have. You are still pretty early in your career so that could be a part of it. Just keep sending apps and broaden your search outside of just remote and eventually you‚Äôll find something.;jkbypro;bcqurbod;9iy90bpze
There are a lot of developers with not only a bachelors degree but also 2-3 times as much experience. You are overestimating the importance of having a bachelor's and underestimating the amount of more experienced developers that are recently out of work.;jkbyjk1;errlk;9iy90bpze
depends on the company;jkcfrhp;jcbvdjm3;9iy90bpze
Your bachelor‚Äôs degree that is not in CS probably weighs more than your experience. I‚Äôve recommended 25 candidates for hire.* 4 have a bachelor‚Äôs* 11 have a master‚Äôs (one is also a PhD dropout and one is working on PhD)* 10 have a PhD14 of these candidates hold a degree unrelated to CS/EE.;jkcnvgz;5psx3671m;9iy90bpze
Since you already have real world work experience an additional bachelor degree would not have made any significant different in your job applications process unless it were from some IVY league college. I think you are beyond a point where a college degree would have helped you. Now your current work experience will help your profile stand out. The reason you got so less replies may not be due to lack of college degree but mostly due to tough job market out there.;jkc0lvm;3ugwhbvs;9iy90bpze
I have one of those. TBH I don't know. I haven't been asked about my educational history after a combo of two things: being about 3 years into my career and moving to a tech hub. So I'm unsure if it's YoE or the local market. Job req's seem stricter in places with less tech jobs. Perhaps that has changed with remote work becoming so regular now but that's been my experience.;jkcs3rr;7s9qbgk00;9iy90bpze
At what point are we gonna stop asking this question every two seconds? Why did so many people flock into CS hoping to get in easy and avoid the fundamental knowledge and experience of a CS degree?It will never be equal. You can have all the experience in the world and someone with same experience but a degree as well is ahead of you.;jkd5led;n97z6eeq;9iy90bpze
"It depends on the company. Some have the luxury to filter out candidates based on education other do it based on experience.&#x200B;You have to deal with the cards you have I can't give you a certainty but I can tell you that having a Bachelor or Master won't make you more interesting and suitable for the company you apply to.

Technically both Associate‚Äôs degree (2 years) and Bachelor‚Äôs degree (4 years) are undergraduate degrees. Most SWE start putting Education in the bottom of their resume after 4-6 years of work experience  below skills experience certificates and side projects. As you know companies are calling employees back into the office. I think WFH is only a perk during COVID-19 and it is ending soon. Most wfh SWE friends I know generally worked in office first before applying for wfh positions. I think that is the case for most companies currently. With mass tech layoffs employers are having an upper hand against employees so WFH positions are very rare right now. Especially with the rise of chatGPT employers would want employees to work full 8 hours not using chatGPT to work for 6 hours then play around for 2 hours.;jkbz7i9;2jvyhe6o;9iy90bpze

No CS degree here.USCIS says 12 years. I started getting unsolicited recruiter spam at around 5 YOE. From FAANG at around 7.;jkd6byn;3htbf;9iy90bpze
I agree with you on this one and it amazes me all the people saying the degree doesn‚Äôt matter. Sure it‚Äôs not 100% necessary but it sure af helps and makes your application be seen more. When 80% of the jobs (or some large percentage) reject you instantly for not checking that box you are only hurting yourself.;jkd3gkq;kqb9a;bcqurbod
That's not really true. Sure it might always be the case with a small handful of companies and therefore TECHNICALLY the answer but as an answer to OP's concerns the reality is that most companies don't really care that much past a certain amount of experience.ETA: Also the more senior you become the more likely it is that you can start to network for jobs instead of having to throw resumes at those filters.;jkcsam7;7s9qbgk00;bcqurbod
Well I do have a bachelor's degree just not in CS. I went back to school for the AS to get into a different field. But point taken;jkc02if;9iy90bpze;bcqurbod
Yeah you get filtered out unless they put an exception for people with experience over X amount of years...but yeah they wont even see your resume for them to consider moving forward.;jkd7di8;6qcqiy00;bcqurbod
I agree I had to recently train someone out from a year long boot camp and they severely lacked the critical thinking and problem solving that higher education forces you into during a degree program. It seemed like they were unable to go their own way and would only do what I asked laying out step by step what they would need to complete. Not saying that people who go to boot camps are all like this but these posts are tiring to see every week.;jkd7ho5;ad4zr;n97z6eeq
I think you under estimate how many companies will auto reject you for not having that degree box checked without been actually looking at your experience.;jkd304f;kqb9a;7s9qbgk00
We've got two senior devs on our team. One of whom is my direct supervisor but he's cool. The other guy is kind of a prick albeit an intelligent one. Unfortunately for the rest of us he's the one who's mainly running things so if you need help or clarification about something it's usually him you have to go through. Although my interactions with the guy have largely been okay I've observed a pattern of disrespect between him and some of the other mid and junior devs. Constantly getting exasperated during meetings interrupting others not-so-subtle comments that others are dumb or lazy etc. I'm not trying to suggest his job isn't stressful just the way he chooses to express it isn't professional imho and makes me view him as unapproachable for guidance even when it's really needed and he's the only one who can give it.Anyway like I said earlier my personal interactions with him have largely been fine. But the story I've been working on lately is confusing the hell out of me and I'm feeling some trepidation about how to navigate this situation because he's the first senior I've ever had who was like this.I'm already looking for a new job (for this and other reasons) but in the meantime I could use some advice on how to deal with a grouchy senior.;13ivb74;9iy90bpze;
Keep everything professional.  Communication and knowledge sharing is part of the standard software engineering job description especially at senior levels.  It's not your responsibility to dance around others who won't accept that you've got a job to do and responsibilities.  The company should be facilitating to make sure you have access to the resources you need to do that job which includes other emploiyees.Keep a cool head ask your questions politely and in the event you hit any wall document the response and escalate it to your manager and let them deal with it that's their job.;jkbv34b;74pdx;9iy90bpze
"Document every incidence of that dev being a prick just in case. If you need their assistance on a ticket and they're not responsive note on the ticket that you are waiting for their assistance and tag them and your PM or PO on it. Always strive for a paper trail to have records of their bad behavior. That way if that person being a jack-ass interferes with your job you can show that it's not just you.I can't stand ""smart jerks"" they usually aren't as smart or valuable as they're being given credit for.";jkctszs;7s9qbgk00;9iy90bpze
I'm not sure what control my manager would really have tbh. The grouchy senior is a contractor of at least equal seniority while my manager is just a regular employee like me.But that said it's good advice. Asking my questions and dealing with my roadblocks is presumably better than just sitting on it and being stuck.;jkbvsfe;9iy90bpze;74pdx
So I'm currently in my second year of study sitting on around a 6.0 GPA (Aus student I guess around an A/80% average score?). Uni is running me down and I want to get into the workforce. I have the option to roll-over credits from previous study shave about a year off my degree and finish earlier. The problem is I didn't do great in that last degree it's unrelated and my grades weren't too great.Seeking employment how do you feel this would effect my marketability? There's a huge demand for IT where I live but yeah. I guess there's no real right or wrong answer but would love to hear some different view points.;13iqtcb;5ncyp0v2;
I'd choose sooner. I really don't like school. Work is much better;jkb7m84;bse6xatq;5ncyp0v2
Wait ? But wouldn‚Äôt it be the same degree but with different grades ? No one cares about grades past your first job.I would just put on my resume the GPA excluding transferred classes and explain verbally if anyone asks;jkbdoya;a9ab24ww;5ncyp0v2
I'd graduate later because I enjoy school. Ideally when I graduate is only determined by how much money I have/owe;jkbc5hd;59bxa;5ncyp0v2
You only do your degree once. You have the rest of your life to work at mediocre jobs.;jkbanon;ukeubsd5;5ncyp0v2
How low does it bring your overall GPA? Would that block off grad school? Does that matter to you? That‚Äôs the only problem I see.;jkbfj33;a04yaf9q;5ncyp0v2
Your degree quickly becomes irrelevant once you enter the workforce.;jkb7cws;3n9372mz;5ncyp0v2
I would optimise for whatever gets you a better job. Isn‚Äôt that one of the main reasons for being in school?;jkbkxvw;3pc3kwoz;5ncyp0v2
Get an internship before graduating. That's what matters.;jkblf7z;q3boi;5ncyp0v2
I'd even extend my degree so I get high GPA overall and can study each course much more deeply.But that's just me I'm more into research oriented work.;jkcrwnm;9h7sk80;5ncyp0v2
Depends. Really really depends. How much of a gap are we talking? If I'm going for graduate school definitely the former.;jkcycd3;m8kccne;5ncyp0v2
Potentially not entirely sure. I think that might be something I would have to talk to faculty about.;jkbvq0u;5ncyp0v2;a04yaf9q
Thanks for bringing this up I think realistically this should be my main concern if I could get this covered it would solve a lot of my problems.;jkbvwgc;5ncyp0v2;q3boi
For what it‚Äôs worth I thought I didn‚Äôt want a grad degree when I graduated then I got frustrated by how often people above me kept making mistakes I could‚Äôve prevented and now I want one. A GPA of 3.0 or above (on a 4.0 scale) is what most seem to require though the reqs relax with professional YOE.;jkcx0lz;a04yaf9q;5ncyp0v2
"I know that remote jobs are very saturated right now but I'm perfectly happy moving to another location as well... in fact I really don't want to live where I do right now for the rest of my life.The issue is that advisors and one recruiter told me that I need to start local. There is no ""local"" here. It's a town of 100 people. Software opportunities = 0.Anyway I'm almost done with my software engineering degree and I'm starting to panic. I still have no network no references and I can only really support myself in a city if I already know I have a job.Do you have to start local or is it possible to just move to another city without any paid experience?Also I'm not talking about FAANG. I'm looking for anything for someone who's curriculum is basically fullstack with Java frameworks for the backend: testing web dev app dev coffee delivery associate whatever else.";13ihess;7ogyqp5wg;
There are no hard and fast rules. But I definitely would not recommend uprooting your life to a random cities and just hoping it works out especially when your cost of living would increase exponentially from a small town. Try remote see if companies would pay for a move but don‚Äôt just up and leave because a recruiter told you to lol;jk9t3ey;t0tno;7ogyqp5wg
Why cant you apply to jobs from where you are and then move once you have an offer and have started? Better than randomly going to a city without a job and no you definitely dont need to start local in a town of a 100 people;jka5mgd;cjldd;7ogyqp5wg
No.Almost no one starts local in CS. I would be hesitant to take any more advice from this advisor.You apply for jobs and move after you get one. A lot of times they will even pay or reimburse for relocation. If not you stay in the crappiest short term rental until you get your first pay check.;jk9tj43;b7id4g6;7ogyqp5wg
People that start local either are in a tech hub. Or manage get few listings availed in their city. I would say most move assuming you don't live in a big metro area. Terms of remote their defiantly out their but tbh given how bad economically seems we're heading -> mix with mass layoffs/hiring freezes just more competitive. If you want remote assume you get one doesn't allow it day 1. I would slowly start bringing the idea. A lot of big companies many teams need be in office but for example my team is fully remote and has no home location. Theirs many teams like this in basically every company just need to find them or slowly convince ur boss let you go remote.;jka4s11;9frn6d3n;7ogyqp5wg
Big companies will pay for your relocation if they insist that you are a hybrid in the office. Small companies... may want to keep you remote.With the use of ATS everywhere you can't just knock on the door of a company and get a job as boomers did. There is no greater benefit to being there in person and paying a fortune for living there while having zero income. Heck you could apply with the ATS while in the Brazilian jungle and have your video call there.Of course there may be some in-person networking you may miss out on but is that worth the price?;jkaolbo;l50ihln;7ogyqp5wg
No you don‚Äôt need to literally start local if there are no local jobs. Just apply to the nearest city and gradually expand your search outward assuming your main goal is to not have to move too far away from where you are now. Perhaps anywhere is better than where you are and you are happy to move. Then apply to jobs where you‚Äôd like to move. Feel free to apply to full time remote roles as well even though you feel they are saturated;jkapllk;53bpbucj;7ogyqp5wg
That was the plan but I was a bit panicked that they would throw out my applications when they saw my zip code. I'll give it a try though.;jkad5nr;7ogyqp5wg;cjldd
>assuming your main goal is to not have to move too far away from where you are now.Nope! I'm not actually from MT though. Home for me is south Brooklyn. I swear my parents had a psychotic break when they decided to move out here lolYou're right though. I might need to work my way back in and my nearest city is at least a step in the right direction. I'd be ecstatic with a remote opportunity though. Thanks for the advice!;jkblwlx;7ogyqp5wg;53bpbucj
You have your zipcode on the resume? Or do they ask in the application?;jkae6fo;cjldd;7ogyqp5wg
Most recruiters and hiring managers will assume if you're applying for some kind of software job straight out of school and not currently located near an office that you're willing to relocate throughout the country. They know your location is just your current location.Normally in the recruiter screening call (first step in interview process) they would then confirm and ask if you're willing to relocate and specifically to where they'd want you.;jkahpl2;suhzz;7ogyqp5wg
If you apply for a non remote job you just gotta be willing to relocate when you get the offer or when they ask you if you are willing to.They might not offer relocation $ (they will let you know that later in the process but then you suck it up until the first paycheck.No biggie. It's not fast food. Companies spend a lot of money flying for on-site/engineering time hiring/interviewing prospects.;jkai58y;14iftm;7ogyqp5wg
Additionally it helps to set your location in job search sites to the location you wish to move to.;jkb6yrz;3fta2;7ogyqp5wg
Yeah my resume has my address and zip on it. Should I omit that part?;jkakab4;7ogyqp5wg;cjldd
Oh ya I would def remove it. Can leave phone number in. Phone github and linkedin are enough.;jkakr9y;cjldd;7ogyqp5wg
Sweet thanks! Sorry if it sounded like a stupid question. I definitely need to do more research on the employment side of things.;jkamca7;7ogyqp5wg;cjldd
Not a stupid question at all. Its something a lot of people do early on. Its just extra info that is not required.;jkb5lk0;cjldd;7ogyqp5wg
Hello AllI am currently stuck on what to do career-wise. I graduated with a BA in Communications and currently work as a Telecom consultant. I was pursuing a Masters in Applied CS from West Georgia before I had to stop because of family matters. I was in the program for 1.5 years and only had a Spring and Summer semester left. One of my issues is that the program had to be completed in 3 years and I missed the cut off due to the family matter. I did have a 3.2 GPA while in the program.I am stuck on what to do from here. I do not know if my credits will transfer anywhere but I would still like to pursue CS. Should I try a boot camp the Odin Project or another grad program?;13ifqsv;178rvk;
See if you can get your credits transferred to another grad program.  Since you are close just try to get that piece of paper (Master‚Äôs degree).;jk9mo5v;q40ylesy;178rvk
Sorry this isn‚Äôt an answer to your question but h was wondering with your BA in communications if the masters program was a bridge program? I have a BA in psych and am seeing most masters for cs wanting a BA in csmathematics or a technical degree;jka5crz;4pt6b21c;178rvk
I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôve talked to your school? See if they can make an exception/if you can petition to continue your studies. It sounds like you had extenuating circumstances. They should want you to finish for their own retention rates at the very least.;jka5tc5;4wjmsew6;178rvk
You should change your Master's to Communication and stop pursuing CS. The CS field is already overly saturated.;jkccyal;bp16b1n;178rvk
"I have offers from two fairly different companies.  Both are similar positions as a high level individual contributor software engineer.  Both are SaaS platform companies.* The established company pays about $60k/year higher base salary.  No equity or bonus or anything else.  They seem like a good company to work for.* The startup would give me 0.6% of the company as equity in the form of stock options vesting over 4 years.  Based on their last valuation (1 year ago) those options are worth $120k after I subtract the strike price.  They obviously want them to be worth more like $500k-1.5m after dilution.  They have raised major capital only once so far with a single VC firm.  They are probably 3-6 years away from selling or getting acquired and will most likely have to raise capital 2-3 more times.  They also seem great to work for and it would probably be more exciting and with more learning opportunity.  The field/industry is not really disruptive and I feel like the main risk would be differentiation or competition.  I would be approximately the 10th employee.I don't really need the cash difference in the mean time so that isn't the biggest consideration.  (The base salary on the startup is ok like $160k.)Mostly I've never worked for or even interviewed at a startup before so I don't know how to properly judge the equity on offer.What would you do?  What do you think I should do?  How should I value the equity?Edit: how much more equity would I need to make it worth it?Obligatory: These aren't San Francisco numbers; I don't live on either coast.";13i8xtx;8d5oj41;
Those options are worth $0 until they're not. Economic conditions can change in a second. Unless you feel like having some big equity payday carrot dangled in front of you I'd take the cash. If you're interested in the work and don't mind taking a 60k cut you can work at the startup but that equity should be treated as $0 in your mind.> I don't need the 60k in the meantime. Unless you've got massive savings to fall back on and you're just working for fun that cash could make a massive difference in times of economic turmoil.;jk8mucw;mrf5akdf;8d5oj41
"$60K/year higher base salary is worth $240k over 4 years. And it's not subject to the whims of startup founders and VCs.$120K of equity in a Series A startup is only worth something ""over 4 years"" if the company gets bought _at that price_. Truth is most startups outright fail. 0.6% of a valuation of $0 is *checks notes* $0. It's a lottery ticket.>They are probably 3-6 years away from selling or getting acquired and will most likely have to raise capital 2-3 more timesIf you leave after 2 years do you get to keep the ""shares"" that aren't traded on a public market? How much of that $120K valuation do you actually get to keep?>I don't really need the cash difference in the mean timeSo you take that cash difference and throw it into a reasonably stable investment. $60K invested in your mid-20s with an annual return of 3% is about $150K in 30 years ($260K at 5%) when you're starting to think about retirement. And you'll be able to do that **four times**.>I don't know how to properly judge the equity on offer.Then you probably aren't prepared to say ""yes"" to that offer. What about share dilution? Vesting schedule? Other games VCs and startups play?";jk8mxxb;etdsy;8d5oj41
"Don't believe their valuation. There's a thousand different games they can play with that including going back to the people doing the valuation and saying ""Do it again but for a higher number"" (I've seen it).Most startups fail and their equity is worth nothing. I couldn't find exact numbers but let's be generous and say 25% of startup's have a liquidity event (I'm sure the real number is lower). This means that even your rosy number of $500k (unless you demand ""fully diluted"" stock the number will go down not up) is worth only $125k so you'd have made more in liquid cash after only 2 years plus a couple of months and that's not counting average returns in the market.Consider also that startups are famously demanding of your time and energy (have fun on on-call with 2-3 people on your team).Frankly if you want to gamble with the money you don't immediately need I think you'd be better off doing so on the stock market where at least all the ways you will get screwed will happen in public and the odds are much better.";jk8zu9h;4hiqq;8d5oj41
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.The higher salary is worth more. What if you hate the job? With the higher salary you get paid until you leave. If the startup is awful that vesting schedule could become golden handcuffs.;jk906ub;ja8fq;8d5oj41
With the information provided so far I personally wouldn‚Äôt take the start-up but it depends on what you want.I‚Äôd want the start up stock options to be currently valued at at well beyond 240k (probably closer to 500k or more) currently to make up for being less liquid and less guaranteed than base salary I am forgoing.;jk8mjqx;32nu9vwc;8d5oj41
$60k/year is definitely better deal than start ups. Also you never know if that start up will do good moneywise in long term.;jk92mte;krnnkvm;8d5oj41
I signed on for the equity of a Series D startup valued extremely high and they folded two months later. Take the established company.;jk9n90i;9xtqp786;8d5oj41
If you're willing to work for hopes and dreams instead of cash you should come work for my startup. Just let me whip up another bullshit valuation where I pretend like my company will be worth 10x more.;jk8sfz6;ukeubsd5;8d5oj41
Well in 4 years time if you go with the established company you are going to get paid an extra $240k.All you can say for the startup is that you're going to get some stock options that are claimed to be worth $120k but there's no guarantee when you will be able to sell them onto the market and what they'll be worth at that time.  Additionally it sounds like you aren't sure if the company can dilute your shares at a later date - so that $120k worth you think you're getting could be a way smaller stake in ownership down the road in terms of percent of shares you own.  To me it sounds like you need to figure out what your exit strategy would be for this startup. If the exit plan is 'hope the startup takes off and my shares are worth a ton of money' I think you're likely going to be disappointed. If your exit plan is - I'm going to take a role driving technical strategy and in 3-4 years time and that's going to allow me to jump to a bigger company at a similar level for much greater pay that is worth more than the money you're leaving on the table today by going to the startup then that is a much better plan.;jk9jgel;5e95ppa2e;8d5oj41
"Would I get to keep them if I leave: I would have 90 days to exercise any options and then I'd get to keep the exercised ones.  Obviously it wouldn't pay out until the company is sold/acquired or IPO's.&#x200B;Share dilution: I am expecting my shares to dilute by roughly 50% just based on average dilution rates for next 2-3 funding rounds.&#x200B;Vesting schedule: standard 4 year with 1 year cliff after which the remaining vest monthly.&#x200B;Other games: no idea&#x200B;(not countering you just answering the questions)";jk8q64m;8d5oj41;etdsy
We do a one on one with our manager to review the development plan this will be used for performance review and help me get promoted (I think?) so am not sure as a junior full stack web dev what kind of course or even books or any online resource I can use to help me move up from being a junior (or software engineer II).Should I learn a tech mt team is currently using that i am less familiar in?;13ix5id;1790u8;
This absolutely depends on what you and your team's needs are. Discuss this with your boss. Of course improving your knowledge in technologies your team uses never hurts but you never know what your manager sees in you unless you ask. Maybe it's not technologies but skills related to working in a team or to working on a large code base?;jkc3pac;1288jr;1790u8
Mmm am supposed to come up with one for review not sure about asking him what he thinks I need to learn.;jkc41mt;1790u8;1288jr
Do you set annual goals with your manager? Goal-setting is really what drives where you focus your studies. Do you have any formal feedback from your team? Sometimes I will get a specific item another dev thinks I should work on during review season. If not you can ask your team's most senior full-stack dev. Keep in mind that if you do have anything you personally are interested in it's important to weigh that as well. Don't let your current job determine your whole career especially if you'll only be there a few years. So also keep your future jobs and not just your next promotion in mind.;jkcutcp;7s9qbgk00;1790u8

Lots of redundant files inside your apps from ""create-react-app"" command as well. Your app design is also pretty awful man... So many typos in your repos too. Anyway quality apps over quantity. Make 1 app look into color theming not using a bootstrap CSS and actually make something pleasant to look at and have it serve some purpose...";jkc7hkd;6xemrvc6;47zqwf6s
Generally the first line for each of your projects is redundant and restates the title of the project. Any detail that you would always expect from that type of project isn't a very good detail (ex. of course you can send/receive with a crypto wallet otherwise it wouldn't really be a wallet). It also looks like you started emphasizing keywords (research papers is bolded) but you only did that twice so you should just get rid of it entirely.The projects seem interesting enough so it's all about how you present them on your resume. You could even consider adding new features that will specifically look good on a resume like adding promo codes and affiliate link functionality to your ecommerce website.;jkcnlaa;do8xl;47zqwf6s
Your resume looks Ok for a rising senior. But currently the job market is bad. With high number of CS grads every year employers generally expect entry level SWE positions to have relevant experience prior to applying. I interviewed some SWE candidates and we generally pick those with internship certificates competition awards or strong extra curriculum that is related to CS. You still have 2 more months until you graduate. I would keep applying for both paid and unpaid internship full time jobs. Not all students get a job offer before graduation. Most get a job offer a few months after they graduate.;jkc242c;2jvyhe6o;47zqwf6s

I am not very proficient in coding yet. I would say I have intermediate web dev skills.But I am trying to pick a career with my specific strengths which right now I would say is my organization skills. I love organizing things to make them easy to find.In coding I make many efforts to make the code folder of the code more organized. Generally I can spend many hours problem solving whether bugs or organizing without getting frustrated. So I‚Äôm not talking everyday organization skills every coder should have.

As we all know job searching sucks. All of the search sites I've tried (LinkedIn Indeed etc.) are mediocre at best with what seem like obvious features missing entirely or really clunky (whether you have security clearance blacklist locations or companies hide senior or intern roles etc.). Are there any APIs available so that I can homebrew a filtering application? It looks like Indeed used to have one but it's since been deprecated and only the employer API is still in service.;13iz48c;6e2xahi;

"If it was easily doable it would have already been done. The challenge with job posts is that companies don't make their job titles the same; they don't list their experience levels the same; they may post the same job in 50 different cities but in the job description say you have to be open to relocating. Indeed Dice Monster etc. have all built companies around building a platform to aggregate sanitize and classify these job posts. Indeed is the best of them but the results are still lackluster - but that's not Indeed's fault it's an issue with the data and the ambiguity. If you still want to give it a shot you can use Indeed's RSS feed to get results and then try filtering them yourself.";jkcpc9n;acf5flys;6e2xahi
This is such a million dollar idea. Build it.;jkchgca;dc8euqz6;6e2xahi
Job sites don't provide public APIs they want that ad revenue. There use to be scripts to scrape their HTML but most no longer work. You can search github to find some now mostly abandon projects.;jkcv46x;43fl7;6e2xahi

Thank you! I hadn't thought of using RSS feeds to get access. Yeah I fully expect that actually parsing whatever I get is going to be a royal pain. I was just hoping to avoid having to do web scraping on top of that.For anyone else that ends up here this post talks about accessing the RSS feed: https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/de9018/indeed\_job\_search\_rss\_feed/;jkcz3xq;6e2xahi;acf5flys
I think I still have code somewhere of a discourse server that I connected to a discord bot to parse links for remote job listings but I only made it to like 3 sites that I supported before I abandoned that project. Web scraping is so easy now with GPT it might be easier to support multiple sites or hook up autogpt even. Ideally the bot could notify alerts on high value listings. I publicly posted the listings I sent to the bot as discourse posts with tags so I had a gui and a comment thread for things like interview notes. I think id rather use notion nowadays but it was a fun Lil project. I'm not a big fan of scraping either but what can you do.;jkd2l9l;a9eat;43fl7
Thanks for such a wonderful reply! TheGratitudeBot has been reading millions of comments in the past few weeks and you‚Äôve just made the list of some of the most grateful redditors this week!;jkczvtm;t1iis5ez;6e2xahi

I'm a software developer. I've thought about building a specialty in integrating with some kind of random niche saas product (eg winery software) and offering that as a consulting service.Has anyone done this or similar? I'm curious if it works.;13iz3zn;bmlxxlgt;
I‚Äôm a freshmen in college and am about to finish my first year in about a month. My current major is business economics and I‚Äôd like to do investment banking but I go to a non target. Lately I was thinking about cs and how much of a better work life balance it would be. Is it too late to start coding from scratch? I have absolutely zero knowledge. Also could I get jobs if I graduate with a business economics degree but minor in CS and am self taught? Would it be reasonable to learn and be a competent swe over the next 3 years?;13ixymo;nyo1v1k;
Maybe job market at the moment is very full people are being denied jobs day to day. And chatGPT is a killer on the loose;jkd5ack;if6lwllj;nyo1v1k
i‚Äôm guessing you go to one of the uc‚Äôs as a bizecon major. there are a lot more careers than swe in tech. you can definitely become a data anayst/ engineer with an econ major and cs minor;jkc7vm2;7m2vzc4ek;nyo1v1k
It's never too late.I went for a non-CS bachelor's in tech dropped out with an AS went back for a teaching degree dropped out without a teaching cert and then managed somehow to become a dev at 30. You're already way ahead of the game from where my messy self was. Maybe pick up a CS 101 course and see how it goes?;jkcvg7t;7s9qbgk00;nyo1v1k
I go to ucsd as a bizecon major. Is SWE going to be extremely difficult for me starting now and especially graduating with a biz Econ major;jkc85jw;nyo1v1k;7m2vzc4ek
frankly that‚Äôs a hard question to answer depends on how motivated you are outside of school with projects and getting experience. experience in university is definitely more important than your major/ minor. i actually went to ucsd for a quarter before transferring. ik cs is highly impacted but can‚Äôt you switch into ds or cogsci? since you‚Äôre only a freshman you‚Äôll have time to catch up.;jkc8eyk;7m2vzc4ek;nyo1v1k
Honestly I‚Äôd like to transfer to UCLA or USC as a junior as my chances of breaking into IB would be much higher there. I have a 3.94 rn and am trying to maintain it to transfer. DS is capped but I‚Äôm not sure about Cogsci. Where did you transfer to?;jkc8ra0;nyo1v1k;7m2vzc4ek
interesting. if you‚Äôre planning to transfer usc is a much better option for IB and it‚Äôll be easier to get into as a 4-year transfer as uc‚Äôs prioritize ccc students. i actually ‚Äútransferred‚Äù to sdsu on a full-ride. i plan on going to grad school so didn‚Äôt want to splurge on my undergrad. i‚Äôm also trying to break into finance but on the quantitative/ research side not front office.;jkc95kw;7m2vzc4ek;nyo1v1k
I see. I should have applied to transfer as a sophomore but oh well. Thanks for the advice though. I wish you the best in your career and life!;jkc9h9g;nyo1v1k;7m2vzc4ek
Hey!Software developer with 4 years experience here. Mostly web applications. .NET C# MVC angular node js TS with SQLServer and Postgres. I've done FE and microservice work. I make $90k/yr in the DC area but when remote. There's an office and I go in occasionally but don't work from there(paperwork id issues etc). I'm a contractor. I started at $78 here 3 years ago and have received excellent annual reviews(top marks literally) have organized and lead development of specific components of applications and taken on pretty much any task they've asked. I recently learned they hired someone who just transitioned to development from a completely unconnected field(think like PE teacher) after completing a coding boot camp for 3 months and then working at that company for a year for very little money to pay them back for the education at $120k. I also learned that while some colleagues make less then me many that I started with or have within 6 months exp of me make more(95-110)My question... Should I stick around and just suck it up? Is my salary pretty decent for this area? I would be willing to work in office 2 days a week max in the DC metro but no more then that. I am screened for government work but no clearance. Thanks for your help!;13irax4;18ksvaxc;
I should probably add I have my bachelor's in computer science as well I guess and am a veteran for what it's worth;jkbcgix;18ksvaxc;18ksvaxc
If your company has given you the highest possible reviews for the past few years and then at the same time hired folks with significantly less experience at higher salaries than you then you already have your answer as to how much they respect you.How you want to deal with that information would be up to you.  Best time to hop jobs unfortunately was last year but there's still opportunities out there for people with years of experience.  What's stopping you from interviewing and seeing what offers you get?  You don't need to quit your current job to apply to other ones.;jkbvvzw;74pdx;18ksvaxc
shop around for some new jobs. doesn't hurt.  You may be able to get some additional money from your current employer;jkcfc9l;53bpbucj;18ksvaxc
I applied to a company they sent me only a document full of Interview questions I filled it out and sent it back they say they want to hire me on. Isn't that odd? No phone interviews no video calls nothing of that at all. I've looked the company up they're real I've never had this happen. Can I get your thoughts on this?;13iaq6f;453l9bnj;
This is a scam. The company is probably real but the person you are corresponding with doesn't actually work there.* Red flag #1 is the questionnaire interview.* Red flag #2 is probably the domain name they are emailing you from. It's probably something like COMPANYCAREERS dot com instead of COMPANY dot com. You can do an ICANN lookup and see the domain was registered very recently.* Red flag #3 and the smoking gun will be an email about sending you a check for equipment.;jk8um0v;328doggt;453l9bnj
check out /r/scam but yes definitely sounds like you are getting scammed.;jk91z86;7m6izsf4;453l9bnj
Yeah the email has [company name]careers.com and they're not asking me for money they're saying they're sending me a check to set up a mini office.Edit: I read your comment wrong thats my bad.;jk8uznx;453l9bnj;328doggt
">and they're not asking me for money they're saying they're sending me a check to set up a mini office.This is the fake check scam and is the most common type of scam out there. The check they send you is fake and will bounce in a few weeks. You're not actually buying things for the mini office you're sending the money back to the scammer under the guise of buying things. You'll notice that they are requiring you to buy from an ""approved vendor"" instead of just buying things as you wish. Any legitimate company that needs you to have equipment for the work will either just send you the equipment or will have you buy it on your own from wherever you want and reimburse you.";jk8vw5z;328doggt;453l9bnj
Yeah and thats what I thought itd be weird to send a check to someone instead of supplying the equipment themselves. But I mean companies are weird I just wasn't sure if the job was legit or not so thank you for this.;jk8w49v;453l9bnj;328doggt

You aren't. Some (all?) of those certificates explicitly say that they are for full-time devops professionals with 2-4 yoe.;jk8vmzn;71xb1d7t;gnh0mou1

"TLDR Edit:I work remotely full time. It is possible that my company will enforce a RTO in the near future. My manager always said they would work with me on this but now my manager has been replaced so I don‚Äôt know if they actually will. I have a few too many obligations to up and move to a new city/state right now. Need advice.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîHi. I‚Äôm a fresh grad working my first SWE job. I interned (in-person) with this company over the summer did well and was given an offer and have worked fully remote since starting in January. I live in a city about 200 miles from my office in Atlanta. Whenever I asked my manager if I would need to relocate I was told ‚Äúcurrently no; But if the company puts out a RTO mandate we will work with you‚Äù. My manager said there is no point in forcing me to come into the office just to hop on a Teams meeting and therefore was not worried about me being fully remote. I‚Äôm not the only one either; One of our most important team members moved to Hawaii in 2020 and has been working remotely since. We also have multiple teammates based out of Poland and India though they work on a hybrid schedule and do come into their offices a couple days out of the week.I was feeling pretty okay about all this until last week when my manager announced he is leaving to a new team. The person who will be taking his place likes me but I think they are a huge proponent of RTO. It‚Äôs all uncertain right now and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I love this job and wouldn‚Äôt hate moving to Atlanta but I have a boyfriend and dogs and friends in my current city that I really don‚Äôt want to leave behind. (BF would have to quit this job in order to move with me too which he does not want to do)Currently there is no RTO mandate but plenty of my coworkers feel like it is coming. I‚Äôm not sure what to do to prepare for this possibility nor what choice I should make if it does become a reality. Pls help ‚ù§Ô∏è";13i9qj8;13te2s;
I wouldn‚Äôt relocate if the RTO mandate tries to force you at some point.  You‚Äôve worked there less than 6 months (beyond the internship) and turning your life upside down losing your bf‚Äôs income and dealing with relocation costs would not be worth it.;jk8t970;q40ylesy;13te2s
>Pls help I'm not sure what help you need here. It sounds like you understand the situation perfectly fine so what advice are you looking for specifically?;jk8rg1m;328doggt;13te2s
Stay firm about RTO you may have nothing to worry about. If it starts getting enforced starting interviewing and cite remote work as the reason you're looking for a new job.;jk8t1td;3htnn;13te2s
What do you think you should do? Spaz out so hard you become depressed over it all before they even mention RTO is coming for sure?;jk8rlcw;ukeubsd5;13te2s
Be ready to interview at any time. That way if RTO comes you can start applying immediately;jkaklji;u80regmy;13te2s
I‚Äôm looking to people with more experience to tell me if I need to prepare to move find a new job or if it is possible to stay firm as a remote employee. I guess I figure people with more work experience than a fresh grad would have some insight based on their own many years in the field. (But I know my own situation better than anyone else here would so maybe getting that advice isn‚Äôt all that helpful idk.);jk8shmn;13te2s;328doggt
Lol basically yeah!I guess I just want to prepare myself so the announcement isn‚Äôt leaving me scrambling. Buuut you have a point. No need to worry myself over something that might not actually happen.;jk8t9b0;13te2s;ukeubsd5
You don't have a lot of leverage as a new grad with little experience. If the company is reallu serious about RTO you *probably* won't be able to stand firm but that ultimately comes down to the company/management. Whether or not you decide to move or look for a new presumably remote job is a personal decision. FWIW my experience has been that fully remote opportunities were a lot more plentiful during the middle of the pandemic but have regressed close to pre-pandemic levels than people would have liked.;jk8u0ys;328doggt;13te2s
Sometimes they announce things to get more voluntary attrition.;jk8v8ap;ukeubsd5;13te2s
Sometimes when I ask just a simple question this particular senior would ramble on and sometimes repeating the points made already multiple times.I understand if it's a complex topic and he wants me to understand it instead of just receiving an answer but this person loves to ramble on something simple.I feel like this seriously reduce productivity as it would take a lot of time before I got my answer to proceed with my work. How would you handle this?;13j1xez;95u8layp;
Have you tried a few things to find the answer your self first? Approach the old wizard only when you really need to;jkcmmty;ct2zfsl1;95u8layp
"It's me I'm the over-explainer. Haha. I have gone full Charlie Day conspiracy mode in trying to give answers more than I would like to admit.I reckon if a dev gets tired of hearing me ramble (I am an out-loud thinker and like being thorough) they can ask me for an action item. ""Hey can I get the take-aways in bullet points?"" Request the TL;DR specifically.";jkcsz4x;7s9qbgk00;95u8layp
Sometimes you gotta interrupt their rambling and give them feedback on being more concise in the future. I see a lot more over explanation in person or on phone calls vs over a chat message because in a chat you only see the results instead of their entire thought process. Part of being a senior engineer is knowing how to mentor and if you can make them better at it they'll appreciate it.;jkcqz9v;do8xl;95u8layp
"Try and narrow down the topic(s) to specific and pointed questions.  For example instead of ""How does this object get populated?"" ask ""I've looked at this object and this specific property.    I followed it all the way to calling this endpoint. I don't see where the endpoint gets the value.  Do you know where the value comes from?  A database?  Another API?""  Then when the senior gets off-track you can interrupt ""Sorry let's get back to what I'm looking for which is the value coming from this endpoint.""I worked with a senior who had more experience than me and he would ramble on tell me the history of this code the reason why they wrote the code the way they did and on and on.  It was annoying.  I would constantly redirect him back to the main question this way.";jkcof3x;eba6;95u8layp
Talking through something is how I know it‚Äôs correct. So you talk through the actual question you talk through its sphere of influence and if your arrival back at talking through the original question it‚Äôs likely a sound thought or solution.A senior doesn‚Äôt know answers to everything they know how to get to answers. Sometimes those answers are wrong and sometimes they are right. It‚Äôs best you take a shot first and then explain what you are trying to get to and why what you did didn‚Äôt get you there. They can then get you reconfigured rather than do it for you.;jkd3c2l;1epi7qwv;95u8layp
"Say it back to the senior in your own words to show you understand it. You can interrupt them for this: ""let just repeat it back to you in my own words to make sure I understand"" then when you're done tell him you're gonna go do it.";jkd6u68;2yu3me11;95u8layp
I personally won't get offended (publicly) I may vent a little in my mind but they're trying to help so I just move on and do my things afterward.;jkcx3xn;3l9jwupi;95u8layp
Dance on your feet like you need the toilet;jkd60fx;o6u7a84u;95u8layp
"Say something like: ""Ok so as I understand <your understanding>. Could you confirm this? Or if I'm wrong could you point out my error?!"" - Ask questions so the answer can be a simple yes / no or mostly constrained to the context.";jkdab5z;kfwaj0t9;95u8layp
Suppose it's more when it's questions when only someone who works within the company knows;jkcur81;95u8layp;ct2zfsl1
"This is a good idea and what I wish I had done this during my internship back in college. OP I want you to know I feel your pain. I worked in person right next to our mentor and there were no chat tools. We would ask simple questions about our task and he would invariably give a big sigh and start with something like ""So back in the 1970s...""I wanted to jump out a window. I might have if the other intern and I hadn't nodded off so much.";jkd1m5m;fdxl8;do8xl
My first lead was like this  I would have to interrupt him and ask more pointed questions until I got to the information I needed. It was slightly rude and made me uncomfortable at first but the guy was just a train of information. It worked out well for us in the end because I got the information I needed and he got to go back to whatever he was doing.;jkd27mn;4ekat;do8xl
"Recently contacted by staffing agencies like PageGroup and Robert Half.  They claim to have offers from ""big"" companies. None of them are in fact big in size reputable in tech or relevant in the global market. They are certainly less prestigious than my previous internship company. The ones I contacted get paid through a percentage cut of my salary obtained from the client company so not the type to press my salary super low. I have rejected WITCH like FDM but honestly I'd take FDM over this. The salary from FDM is not much lower but I'd get a much nicer looking resume as the client companies are mostly reputable blue chip ones even the worst are something quite well-known.Overall bad chemistry with one agent. Job offers not very attractive. What are your thoughts/experience on this type of agency companies?";13j1bos;9h7sk80;
I don't know if that's only me or not the thing is I feel extremely unmotivated to do any work after the standup meeting.I switched job and I have same problem in the new job but still it feels like standup takes all the energy out of me early in the morning)* I find standup meeting. unnecessary* some people talk too much and explain unrelated topics or talk about a 10 minute task like a 8 hour progress * and there is always some (know it all) who has to comment and question everythingI know this question sounds like a rant but just wanted to know if other also have same feeling and what is their solution?;13j101d;4blibjle;
It's a common fault in the stand-up system meetings running too long people not sticking with the 3 basic questions (What did you do yesterday? What will you do today? Do you have any blockers?) and interrupting other team members. It's the job of the scrum master specifically and the team in general to control the flow. If there's anything else to be discussed like a support issue or a coding question it should be done after the meeting and only with the people needed not the whole team.;jkcj4wb;is2izcr;4blibjle
I don't really understand how sitting through a 15-30min meeting where people talk about their work demotivates you to do your own work. Are you able to explain exactly what it is about this standup that causes you to lose motivation?;jkcry7h;5fqhe;4blibjle
"It's typical when the stand-up takes too long. People lose focus and their brains go into standby mode and then after the meeting you have to kind of ""wake up"" again. It's not that different from trying to get going right after taking a nap.";jkcw03x;7s9qbgk00;4blibjle
All depends on the PM. We only do ours like twice a week;jkcpgll;q1hwfnu;4blibjle
You mean before and after? Yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up yeah :);jkcz4k4;r1cb5l8;4blibjle
Well I go into standup feeling unmotivated then standup doesn't change that for me. So yes.;jkd4gg1;9ua93wof;4blibjle
Bruh don't even start our standup/collab runs for an hour and a half. I'm fucking suicidal.;jkd5tjc;9utoz;4blibjle
On my previous work standup just basically a daily progress report. Some people talks too much or share lots of details and it stretches beyond 15 minutes. Then you have a parking lot that will take another 10 to 15 minutes.Recently just joined a team no stand-ups and just a weekly meeting. I liked it better.;jkd75ew;103dsq;4blibjle
"Yes those meetings are the worst and provide almost no value except for a handful of egotistical people at the top who like to see their peons lined up in a row. People aren't learning about what their team is up to. They are thinking about what they are going to say what they did say and what they're going to do as soon as stand up is finally over. Plus one of the three supposed reasons for standups is horse s***: ""any blockers?"" If someone has a blocker this should not wait until the next morning's standup to get help! Source: I've literally been in thousands of standups.";jkd7z0p;8g4jo;4blibjle
It's a fair point that it's scrum master's job to manage the meeting. but I don't think if anyone in the industry does that properly.I think it's out of my control how meeting is being held but I can do something for me to make it tolerable and be able to work on my staff afterward;jkcmidc;4blibjle;is2izcr
"if you are fine with it good for you. how do you manage to do that?> Are you able to explain exactly what it is about this standup that causes you to lose motivation?I really don't know. it feels like it drains all of my energy. one of the comments was > you have to kind of ""wake up"" againand that sums up everything for me";jkd2z30;4blibjle;5fqhe
I explained it better than me it really feels like I need to wake up again;jkd3229;4blibjle;7s9qbgk00
You are in control of it. You're part of the process. Speak up and express your thoughts. If a process is not productive then it has to change.;jkd22w9;57xmr3fu;4blibjle
I think the underlying issue is that it sounds like the work doesn't really excite or motivate you. For example I don't really like standup so I want it to end so I can get back to doing my job. It motivates me to get out of standup asap so I can get back to actually being productive. The part that I'm confused about is you seem to have the opposite reaction as me to standups despite us both disliking them. I think if the work excited or motivated you then you wouldn't feel the need to constantly remotivate yourself (or wake yourself back up) to start working;jkd4c7i;5fqhe;4blibjle
"your first example describes me. I clock in at 8 and start with my job then 8:45 is the stand up meeting and i get interrupted since at that time ive warmed up and just do the coding. After the stand up which 15 min we have this fucking office rule to have coffee break 1h later and it usuallt starts when someone rings on a fucking bell in office kitchen to make other aware ""its coffee time"". Like bro let me do my shit i take my break in lunch or sometime when i feel the code looks gg";jkdan1b;9xjk5vd;5fqhe
Its been a little over 3 months since I last coded. I used to be fairly comfortable with coding dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and today I tried Leetcode questions 38 and 88 and cant even get close to getting a solution. I feel like my brain is closed off. I have an interview in 4 days and I'm feeling extremely nervous now that I cant do a single problem. What should I do? Any suggestions are welcome;13j0c6k;hlxpqhui;
question: before when you were ‚Äúfairly comfortable‚Äù with algorithms did you understand the underlying algorithm or did you just memorize how to solve certain patterns?;jkd5ef0;gqchppc2;hlxpqhui

Hello everyone I have been applying since January without much luck in getting interviews. I have gone through several Iterations of my CV/Resume.I was recently told I have too many bullet points in my CV or that I have too much text. I would really appreciate the help in reducing/improving my bullet points into solid content.I am having a hard time striking balance between being clear and concise and selling myself to job recruiters...  I am trying to get FullStack Position as it is what interests me the most. I would settle for a Backend position or a Front-end Position. Getting a Full-Stack  position with an emphasis on DevOps would be the dream but I have very little in my profile in terms of DevOps.Old CV:[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G\_\_tENnOLhUoLhY5gZEQYZA2bxmhcVCh/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G__tENnOLhUoLhY5gZEQYZA2bxmhcVCh/view?usp=sharing)  New CV:[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nvny\_Jx-Tsqa2M-6cWDMYkKbgPDNtqMj/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nvny_Jx-Tsqa2M-6cWDMYkKbgPDNtqMj/view?usp=sharing);jkcxwfq;bcorr2j40;7t7ivtl0

Wish I had more quantifiable metrics but unfortunately we are never given any (and the problems I solve are somewhat hard to quantify). Not necessarily looking for anything in particular could be web or something else. Just hate my current job lol[Resume](https://imgur.com/a/BacaVcS);jkd2msl;6cit3;7t7ivtl0

4 YOE software developer in the US. I have applied to around 60 positions. Frontend backend fullstack with only one phone call with a member of HR. I took a year and a half off to start my own design business where I made furniture and lighting. Now that I am a parent I am wanting to make it back to tech. I have a porfolio website that showcases some UX projects as well as a blog that I update with progress on an app I am making with vue.  I am looking for any feedback on my resume!  Any help is appreciated! [Resume](https://imgur.com/a/Nmf74PV);jkd7m3h;eytas;7t7ivtl0
"1. Work experience comes first followed by Education then Projects IMO.2. Your resume format looks like ass. The first blue line padding is less than the second blue line's padding... Same thing for the 3rd and 4th blue line. I don't know if this happened because you were masking personal info before sharing on here but if you want to continue using this that's fine but fix the inconsistent layout.3. Keep your Projects concise it's too bloated. Don't bold and underline the same things you're repeating yourself quite often ""uses firebase"" ""**Firebase**"" ""built on React.js"" ""**React**"" etc. Also when you say ""**website**"" HTML and CSS are already assumed don't bother listing ""HTML and CSS"".4. Think about quality apps. To-Do List Recipe Search API etc are all very typical tutorial apps. Find something special more personalized or something more complicated. IE: Netflix clone isn't special anyone can do that following YT Tutorials.

If you're looking for a particular specialization (front/back/generalist) worth mentioning it early on - if you're publishing the resume. If you're only sending it directly to employers doesn't really matter though some people have several versions of their CVs tailored for particular types of JDs.;jkcka32;1288jr;5zlnk54e
Which makes me wonder: is it really worth to mention non-IT jobs at all?;jkckdm0;1288jr;6xemrvc6
Hey all I really need your help.I've had really tough experience with college. I've had to leave univeristy twice for academic probation. I'm barred from my university but can return if I take a certain math class at a community college first. If I returned I'd have 2 years of classes to finish my degree. It would be a degree in Network and Digital Technology B.A. Although (if I select the right electives) the content of my degree would be almost identical to a CS degree at my univeristy I don't think my degree would look as good on a resume and so I feel  like it's not worth the debt (zero financial support from family) nor the time. I feel like since my degree has less prestige than a cs degree I feel like I would need more projects to supplement my resume aside from project classes but if I gotta do all that anyway maybe my time would be better spent just learning on my own and building a portfolio. I would have to work part-time while pursuing college since I screwed my financial aid with bad academics and along with my other life commitments I'd basically have no extra time outside of work school and life.One part of me just thinks college isn't for me I also have bipolar disorder and only recently got diagnosed and looking back I think that's a big part of why I have had so much academic troubles. I just really don't feel confident in going back to school and succeeding.I'm determined to make it into the tech industry. Although I failed out of school my programming classes were always my best subject and the only classes I felt like weren't a total drag. In learning coding on my own I feel convinced that I have kind of an aptitude for coding and so I'm set on trying to get into SWE degree or no.I'm 24 now and I feel so behind in life just working in fast food and all. I'm really struggling with life right now and I would really really appreciate advice in career or just in life. Thank you.;13iwdb0;slq3m;
> One part of me just thinks college isn't for me I also have bipolar disorder and only recently got diagnosedYou should focus on making sure your mental health is in a good state first. You dont want to burn out again so make sure you're in a healthy mind state before going back to college. If you have free time there's plenty of local free resources online that will make sure your skills stay up to date.Dont worry about age Ive worked with some amazing engineers who started in their 30s.;jkc0hgv;3ui5xo8g;slq3m
I'm looking for CS adjacent careers where I'll not have to just sit infront of a screen all the time. I came to know about the data center technician job and it seems like it's an interesting role.I am from India and have a bachelor's in CS. I looked at jobs on LinkedIn and most require previous experience in data centers. And there weren't that many mostly telecom companies and Oracle. I've some experience with Linux cloud and some python. But I've never worked with cabling RAID computer hardware. Also it seems there are fewer data center jobs here in India as there's mostly offshore software development work.Any suggestions on how to get into this line of work? And if there aren't enough roles here in India should I try abroad?  I'm willing to take short term courses or training for that.;13itwa5;ktc9nwfh;
DC techs are blue collar jobs you don't need a degree for it. You don't do any programming. Basically you need to be good at following instructions and following them exactly. Think factory worker.;jkbotoc;6oa3x;ktc9nwfh
Oh. Is that so. No troubleshooting repair scripting etc? I saw some profiles on LinkedIn. These guys have listed designations like storage engineers server engineers network engineers etc. Many profiles listed as Senior data center technician at Microsoft Oracle Amazon. They've mentioned installations monitoring configuration type of work. Not totally averse to all this if there's some level of problem solving skills and abilities involved.;jkbqmed;ktc9nwfh;6oa3x
Engineers and techs have different responsibilities. Engineers will create the manuals/steps that techs need to follow. If you link the job description then I'd better be able to judge which it falls under.;jkbr0w8;6oa3x;ktc9nwfh
I see. This is one job I found on LinkedIn. Let me know what you think about this. Thank you.https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3590118036;jkbs4gp;ktc9nwfh;6oa3x
Yeah that isn't a tech role. Id consider it more along the lines of SRE or DevOps or IT. It sounds like it's what you are looking for since it doesn't appear to be development.;jkbt4ql;6oa3x;ktc9nwfh
I have been on an assignment that is working out well for me but I have been successful and feel deserving of a raise. I still have a ways to go on my assignment so I don‚Äôt have any natural opportunities coming up to talk about raises.I am interviewing for some new roles and they all pay more. I would prefer to stay in my current job with a raise but am willing to leave for more money with any of the companies I am interviewing with. With some interview pipelines finishing I am wondering what the best approach is to get my current job to give me a raise if I get an offer.Do I talk to my agency or my manager? Is there a good chance that they might match an offer or do agencies and their clients avoid negotiating in these situations?;13itkhm;crlro7a0;
I'm a CS undergrad contributing to a SWE research and development project for a large company based in Santa Clara CA.The opportunity was arranged by my university in an experimental program. The idea is that we work for them on an internal project unpaid for 6 months in exchange for experience some degree credit and a shot at a full-time position afterwards.In the beginning their business director was enthusiastic about retaining all 5 of us. Even still I poured my soul into this. I got recognized for it last week and asked to come on-site to apply my designs in their physical testing environment. My designs worked and I received a lot of positive feedback.The problem is that while I was there the senior in the room was indirectly signaling that they didn't have as many jobs opening as they did 4 months ago. I low key feel a bit upset / disrespected but at the same time it sort of feels like I'm not allowed to be? And I'm just not really sure how to navigate this situation and could use some advice.;13iotit;hjhq5qp0;
>The problem is that while I was there the senior in the room was indirectly signaling that they didn't have as many jobs opening as they did 4 months ago. I low key feel a bit upset / disrespected but at the same time it sort of feels like I'm not allowed to be?There's a lot of things that could have caused that shift most of them not in the senior's control. Things can change a lot in 4 months especially in a somewhat uncertain economy. There are layoffs happening daily.There was never a guarantee of retaining any of you. That the senior is hinting that they don't have _as many_ openings implies that there are still _some_. And since you've gotten positive feedback so far you might still be OK.There isn't anything you can do right now except keep doing the work keep making a good impression on them get that experience. And if it turns out that you don't get the job you'll find something else later.;jkay5bq;etdsy;hjhq5qp0
You ask your manager about potential for retention. This isn‚Äôt a social relationship. You need to know and they might already know. They understand that you would need to start applying elsewhere.;jkb2upx;2tu8n7l9;hjhq5qp0
If it‚Äôs Intel it‚Äôs macroeconomic factors.;jkb6gaj;8y9kaxy;hjhq5qp0
So I just got laid off late last week my previous experience was in IT not CS. I have minimal coding skills primarily my skills are derived from my use of Powershell and my current learing of Python. I applied for some state sponsored training through the State of Massachusetts unemployment opportunities. My question is how do people who do this like me fare in the market as opposed to those who are self taught and those with degrees.I understand that Powershell is not a coding language but it is based on C and I have a little experience with it. I also understand that self taught individuals don't typically fare very well in the market as opposed to those with Bachellore's or higher.;13inhg3;4scge;
I'm pretty sure powershell is a programming language. No degree at all almost certainly significantly worse on average but maybe still fine. The economy should eventually recover. And if you really give a shit you can do a real degree online.;jkapgyc;ukeubsd5;4scge
"I am making a career switch (to CS) and my portfolio currently only consists of my own projects. (I've been coding as a hobby for years.)I have 2 acquaintances who want to hire me to build an app/web site for them.As a ""non-professional"" what kind of hourly rate should I ask for?Full disclosure most of the coding and technologies I'm already familiar with but I will definitely be doing some learning on the job.I currently live on the East Coast of the US if that helps with cost of living considerations.Thanks.";13ila9u;h49j8;
I would say it depends on how friendly you are with them and if they are aware that you‚Äôll be learning as you go. If so I would try to come up with a reasonable price for the completed product and they can pay you at milestone points. That way it isn‚Äôt tied to hours at all and the only part you have to manage is how many hours you end up needing to put in to get the project done within the timeframe you would like to. If this is strictly professional then I‚Äôd say maybe $25-$30? Pretty sure that was what we offered to charge when a former professor and I pitched a project to a company in college. I wouldn‚Äôt work for free or super undervalue yourself but another consideration is how much you need money from the projects to be able to do them;jkaek51;6a1v7tv4;h49j8
Project managers how much do you work? Is it more or less than same as devs? I‚Äôve heard of devs only working 3 hour days and I‚Äôm wondering if that applies to PM as well?;13il9l7;4kb6vo1w;
Not a PM but based on talking with the PM for my team then I think he averages more hours than I do but with lower intensity tasks that are more flexible for when they can get done or just more meetings that he just has to attend.;jkaf19h;6a1v7tv4;4kb6vo1w
Thanks so much;jkavdn7;4kb6vo1w;6a1v7tv4
"So background about a month ago I applied and interviewed for an application developer position at an insurance company whose mascot rhymes with tuck.  The team and hiring manager had good things to say about me and I was given an offer for 80k.  I don't have a lot of experience in SQL specifically and even though the role is somewhat heavy SQL they seemed ok with this.  My resume includes experience from internships so when I formally applied in order to get in their system to get the offer this experience was included.  Then when the background check came I was told to exclude it since it wasn't paid experience and the companies I worked for aren't in business anymore.  So I just included paid experience which is 2 years.  HR then raised the issue that I didn't have 4 years of experience which is required by the role according to company policy.  The HR person said they would try to get an exception approved but today I got a call saying they had to rescind the offer since I didn't have the required 4 years of experience for the role.  The HR person on the phone said that I couldn't be brought on to the role because it would create ""employee inequity"" which is a policy they implement as advised by their legal department.   The silver lining is that they might be able to put me in for a more junior role but the pay would be less.&#x200B;Has anyone ever has this experience or have any advice?";13il5zb;12guuv;
Companies down level candidates like this all the time. Go along with it but keep looking for other jobs.;jkar6zf;ukeubsd5;12guuv
Quack quack I‚Äôm a duck;jkachec;7b5kr54o;12guuv
They're implying that everyone with the same years of experience has to get paid the same according to their legal department? Sounds like bullshit;jkaeprs;sqkgkj9w;12guuv
Tbh this is a red flag.  Companies are doing this more to take advantage of the current market.  Somewhere tried to offer me an entry level position with 8 yrs of direct experience.  Ot only means they‚Äôre going to nickel and dime you every chance they get;jkakxtm;9fk72eas;12guuv
Sounds like they were looking for a reason to pay you less.;jkbcr73;uobu165f;12guuv
wtf that's so dumb.;jkbh8st;53bpbucj;12guuv
If they offer me the junior role I‚Äôll take it because I was laid off recently and  don‚Äôt have anything else lined up. This is certainly proving to be a tough market a year ago I would have told them to kick rocks.;jkau4y6;12guuv;ukeubsd5
Does sound a little sus like a bait and switch tho;jkaclgb;7b5kr54o;7b5kr54o
I mean if they come back with the offer for the more junior role you might be right but I guess we'll see.;jkadafm;12guuv;7b5kr54o
15 year SWE here - I had a really good interview today for a company that has a fairly brief hiring process.Initial phone screen with hiring manager 1 hour interview with 3 senior devs which went very well and there is 1 more (hopefully) interview with the CEO and CTO to follow.I'm sending a followup email just to thank the senior devs for the call - do I CC the hiring manager on it as well. I may be overthinking this but I really want this role love the company and just would like an opinion either way.Thanks :);13ijkgz;12v6vp;
"If you send an email to the senior devs sure cc the hiring manager.I'm not a fan of followup emails but if you send one keep it very brief genuine and don't gush.  Something like ""I felt that it was a good discussion today.  It seems like an interesting position.""  Pretty much anything you say will not influence their opinion except a brief confirmation that you are still interested (that is ""interesting position"").";jkaf0n6;q40ylesy;12v6vp
I hear ya. I want to keep it brief but before I could send it hiring manager already sent me an email saying I made it to next round (which is last round with CEO).Do I still send the email?I love the industry it's my passion but I hate the hiring process.;jkafnfa;12v6vp;q40ylesy
I think that it's fine to send one since you made it to the next round.  Just an acknowledgement.;jkak2ru;q40ylesy;12v6vp

I posted a few weeks ago asking for advise in pursuing a CS career and you guys were tremendously helpful. Though I am still doing independent study I decided college would be the path thanks to that post. I work a full time job currently (3 24h shifts a week) and am not in a position where I can leave that therefore online schooling is the way to go. At work I can bring a laptop or use my computer and attend class online relatively uninterrupted. The problem I find is when I search for online schools it seems im not getting anywhere productive. Any advice on schools or experiences similar to mine would be appreciated. Thank you!;13ihwjs;2g5u8raw;
Check out WGU it's completely online you can move at your own pace and it's very affordable.;jk9vwue;9dzuj5pm;2g5u8raw
I have completed 2 years in a MNC working as a software developer in asp.net.have been promoted to Senior software engineer. also have another yearly review due in June. I'm wanting to switch. When is the best time for it? Should first get an offer letter from a company then put my resignation? Or can I resign first? Also is there something like it's better to resign in the first week of the month? Any input is helpful! TIA;13ick9m;rs7za5qz;
1. Apply for positions2. Get interviews3. Get offer(s) you like4. Sign and confirm the best one5. Give notice at current jobYou _can_ resign without having a new job lined up but you may find yourself searching for many months and you'll be tempted to take whatever gets thrown at you just so you can make rent.;jk94oka;etdsy;rs7za5qz
why...would you resign first before you have a job? That's....not great.;jk9cl1n;4kvzvlo;rs7za5qz
Wait until you have a signed offer and a start date. Don't give notice until after any upcoming vests/bonuses have hit your account. Don't tell anyone let your manager decide when/how to announce that you're leaving.;jk9evo8;11m62d;rs7za5qz
Wait until you have a job offer and preferably after processes like background checks complete before resigning.> Also is there something like it's better to resign in the first week of the month?Depending on your employer how long you keep your employer's health insurance coverage is tied to your last day. My last employer had it where you keep coverage until the last day of the month your last day was. Leaving early in the month may be a good idea.;jkba9ig;a9ikm;rs7za5qz
My goal is to develop the skills which would help my company see me as very valuable and I would like to move up (and increase my income) as quickly as possible. Luckily enough this company seems like a great place to work so far at about 2 months in.I know my learning path is probably specific to the company and I am still pretty green. Sadly my company doesn't do pretty much any cloud stuff so AWS/Azure stuff is on the backburner for now even though I love that shit.Obviously furthering my learning of my company's deployment and containerization software would be largely important. I don't want to list all the stuff we use cause I don't wanna give too much information though I think it is pretty common software plus some RedHat stuff.But ideally I would like to learn of some resources for on-premises DevOps learning/practice as well as how I could advance my knowledge to go from a Junior to a Senior level of understanding. I know this will take time and that I should be absorbing as much as possible. But I just want to do all I can while I have the energy to put myself in a good place for the future.;13ib95x;httv5g7i;
Definitely cloud and infrastructure skills are needed nowadays and in the future if you want to be a senior software engineer. It would be fantastic if you shared more information about your experience there but if you don't perhaps you could upload your resume in [this free app](https://smartcareer1.bubbleapps.io/) (it has been built to help computer software guys like us figure out your career options based on your experience and background and show which trendy skills are missing in you);jk922wv;l7j029jg;httv5g7i
So I‚Äôm 24f currently working at a very good company. However the job is not the best. It‚Äôs not challenging in any sort of way and i can feel myself getting burned out from doing the bare minimum. So i‚Äôm thinking of trying out new things but I‚Äôve only been exposed to web dev and devops so far and im sure there are more interesting things to do out there. What other fields are there that combined with computer science can make for awesome projects?;13ib2hq;30nud3y3;
Security is definitely worth checking out! It's always changing and evolving. With your computer science background you can dive into stuff like ethical hacking securing networks and protecting data. You can also work in pretty much any industry like transportation healthcare tech defense etc.;jk99lq8;vryk6fx8;30nud3y3
Health insurance /sWe're doing some cool stuff with ML AI big data etc actually. But in any company with huge amounts of people it's easy to land in a role that supports the claim dispute & resolution software (hospital typo dropped grandma from coverage two days before she bought the farm so they billed her instead of us WTF) or even worse the billing collections software (hey guys this dude owes us $3m WTF) Make sure you have a clear picture of what you want to do and try to find a niche. If you're senior enough you can plot your own path but starting out is a bit tough.;jkabgxv;biv3tyhx;30nud3y3
I have a friend who has a website for a company that sells some health products. He took over the company and needs a developer to add some changes to the site. I did a change for him just for free to help him out. He then pushed for a new page and some other integrations. He repeatedly mentioned how easy it would be and I had to change his opinion to ‚Äúwell it is easier for me then you but it by no means is a copy and paste job.‚Äù I said I can‚Äôt do the ~20 hours of work without some kind of compensation. He said he‚Äôd give 1% equity in the company since they are cash poor. It is valued around 100k I really don‚Äôt even know how it would work. Him giving 1% equity and I sign something and basically I am on call 24/7 now? Does anyone have experience navigating something like this? I was thinking about asking for 3% and saying a certain number of hours I could work on this a week. Is there questions I should be asking?;13i8s5j;5zql6;
If you take the equity you will be doing the job without compensation.So it depends on whether the equity is 1%/3% of a corporation or a partnership.  If it is a corporation he is legally supposed to pay you minimum wage and if he doesn't (many don't) you can sue him later for unpaid wages.  The sensible thing for him would be to offer say $400 for 20 hours work and you take it because he's a friend even though that's a low hourly rate.  If he can't afford $400 he has no business offering equity.  Giving out equity for even a few weeks work let alone 0.5 week is more trouble than it is worth.I feel that you and your friend are forming business links between you that at this stage you should not be forming.  It's just too early.;jk8ost1;q40ylesy;5zql6
Tell him to either find someone else or pay you $100 per hour with a $1000 retainer paid up front.;jk8stg0;ukeubsd5;5zql6
"*RANT* I just got a rejection email this morning from this employer I was talking back and forth with for ~ 3 months. The guy basically held my hand the entire time and kept asking if I was onboard with their whole startup project every passing month and I agreed repeatedly. But then this month we finally get to do a virtual interview (we talked over the phone for those 3 months prior) and the interview goes decent I explain my experience etc I send a nice email afterwards yadda yadda yah. However the dude gave me the cold shoulder after I sent the follow up email thanking him for the interview by not even replying. And now today I get some BS rejection email at 4AM which I replied to immediately chewing the employer up in the most high brow way possible. Idk if my physical appearance didn‚Äôt fit the bill for what he was looking for or what because we always had a consistent back forth communication so it was weird for this to happen after the first and only virtual meeting. Like I‚Äôm super fucking drained by this constant stream of bullshit. Why waste my time for all those months? I‚Äôve literally been building a genuine startup company during the whole 3 months I code every goddamn day 10+ hours in like 3 different languages and platforms; it‚Äôs destroying my health. I‚Äôve built so much high spec full stack cross platform shit for the startup in the time it took the dude and his two ‚ÄòML Engineers‚Äô to train their crappy ‚Äòexercise‚Äô ML model. It‚Äôs not even like it was a full role either it was a damn iOS internship like are you shitting me? I even have prior Mid-level full-time experience diverse projects and a B.S. in ECE from last December yet I can‚Äôt even get that internship. I‚Äôm a grown ass man with bills to pay I‚Äôm also an M.S. student and I‚Äôve been unemployed for an unjust amount of time on the account of this recession lol. I don‚Äôt have time to play pretend with these employers. Why do these people insist on constantly trying to waste our time?";13i6zqq;n7uih39;

"HiIn a few months I'll have to review my coworkers as part of annual performance review.Just wondering how much honesty I should put into that.&#x200B;So there is this mid-level engineer who is obviously underperforming he has made zero progress for 6 months contrary to other coworkers that took hints tips feedbacks more seriously.He is slow to understand slow to deliver the work he delivers is of poor quality.Essentially he brings the team's performance down by needing constant handholding from the team and delaying priorities by being so slow on delivering so other engineers have to make mental gymnastic to deliver their own work it's a real burden.I'm considering reporting that to my manager to leave him a chance to improve before having to send a blazing review on this engineer.But on the other hand is that really my business ? Should I just be quiet and let it be ? I don't \*have to\* say anything weither good or bad.&#x200B;Having to handhold this manchild does annoy me but that's allI'm growing detached from whatever the team/company is doing and seeking to leave anyway.To be fair I was quite motivated working there before having to work with this useless guy but he made his way in the company and stayed for this long so I guess he's the kind of guy the company is looking for therefore I'm bound to meet other crap engineers by staying there.&#x200B;What would you do ?";13i5q3h;4jnrqzcl;

Unless it impacts my ability to look good/valuable or impacts my workload I don‚Äôt fucking care.I have to help one dev on my team quite a bit.  I just end up scaling down my other work as much as I can and make sure I let my manager know I am helping them.  I won‚Äôt ever write poor feedback for them because they aren‚Äôt really negatively impacting me.I give them feedback verbally (so they can improve if they want) but not in a way that it will be used against them;jk8lztg;32nu9vwc;4jnrqzcl
"I tend to not give ""blazing"" feedback in annual reviews.  Put yourself maybe in some different shoes.  If your manager never gave you feedback the entire year and then -- from your POV -- absolutely eviscerated you in your annual review how would that feel?  I tend to let my manager know my concerns when I have an underperforming co-worker in our weekly 1:1 but honestly it isn't my job to take down nor promote this person's career.  I write objective feedback and error very much on the side of helping the person's career.  If my manager chooses to PIP the person that is up to them.  But when your manager or skip reads this out-of-the-blue horrible feedback it reflects equally poorly on the writer.";jk8oydi;3u84d;4jnrqzcl
>I'm considering reporting that to my manager to leave him a chance to improveWait NO one has told your manager yet?  Or your manager has not noticed his output is no where near the others on your team?;jk8stny;b532p;4jnrqzcl
Never talk bad about others unless they actually harm your work or make you suffer.

Don't be a narc. Say a couple good things and one or two points of earnest constructive criticism.Unless he's actively making your job worse you shouldn't care.;jk92sls;bw7mr;4jnrqzcl
I always give pretty glowing reviews even if it‚Äôs not true or if I haven‚Äôt worked with the person enough to really say. I‚Äôm not going to write a bad review that might mess with their job I don‚Äôt own the company and I want them to continue making a living.;jk91xoc;w312qcn2;4jnrqzcl
Mandatory disclaimer: are you his peer or more senior? Are you sure you see the full picture?If yes let's proceed to practical approach. It really depends on company culture but my approach would be something like this: wait until we have a 1:1 then when they ask if I have any concerns I would reply that X might be struggling is there anything I can help with? If you don't have regular onetoones grab them for a brief meeting. Just don't sound as judgemental or accusatory: your goal should be to help the team and this person not produce a nice patch of scorched earth. Afterwards I would attempt to raise this issue no more than one more time because it's unlikely to make any difference. If your boss considers this an issue worth fixing they would fix it without nagging.;jk8ce1b;1288jr;4jnrqzcl
So you‚Äôre thinking of leaving and asking if you should fuck this guy‚Äôs job up before you go for no clear benefit to yourself?I would keep quiet man.;jk8xwwr;ekcnruc4;4jnrqzcl
How long has he been a developer on your team?;jk8bs8s;bh2qj3jm;4jnrqzcl
If you don't have anything to gain because you plan to leave anyway I would just write some plain review and call it a day.I would only report on people that impact my job and hence my performance other than that I am like w/e.;jk90g99;8wtp2;4jnrqzcl
Assessing and judging others is extremely problematic. Unless you have specific training or education on the subject which I do not I would try and keep my feedback as minimal and fact oriented as possible. Do not draw opinions or cast blame. Just stick to a few absolute facts and leave it at that.;jk97o6v;8g4jo;4jnrqzcl
"I have a very simple rule when doing these:If my coworker is underperforming *and* it's negatively impacting my ability to do my own job I'm going to be honest. And I don't mean the ""impacting the team"". If they are directly impacting *my* personal ability to do the things that *I* need to do. It's not my responsibility to endure problems created by others so I will use the opportunity to remove the problem. HOWEVER. If my coworker is underperforming and they're *not* negatively impacting my ability to do my own job I'll write a vaguely positive review and leave it at that. I'm not their manager. I don't know what may be going on in their lives or career that might be impacting things. It's not my responsibility to project my own expectations onto others or to punish others for not living up to them. The one grand exception: Assholes. I've absolutely left scathing reviews for good devs in the past simply because they were antisocial assholes that nobody wanted to work with. If you can't act like a professional in a professional workplace you don't get to be upset when your coworkers decide that they don't want to work with you anymore and dogpile your annual review to try and get you fired.";jk9cxe9;jigwr;4jnrqzcl
The only time I've given truly bad feedback about someone is when I was asked to write a performance review for someone off cycle and it wasn't for a promotion. The person was also terrible and didn't accomplish anything so I could tell they were building a paper trail to fire them.;jk8uyx6;6pn3d;4jnrqzcl
Manager here. If it‚Äôs impacting your work and overall team then yes‚Ä¶be truthful. Now that being said I can‚Äôt stand peer reviews. They are so filled with biases and personal experiences that sometimes do not have anything to do with output. So I guess my advice would be‚Ä¶Be tactful but don‚Äôt hold back the truth and explain how your team is being impacted. Don‚Äôt inject personal feelings.;jk97xcx;bom43yvg;4jnrqzcl
You're looking to leave anyway. Just don't say anything about him. Throwing him under the bus means he'll probably get a PIP and then fired.;jk99x0d;eyyfxhq;4jnrqzcl
Negative review feedback should never come as a surprise. If you've never talked to him about this previously and given him a chance to improve I would not put it in a formalized review.;jk9vegm;rdotl;4jnrqzcl
Yes feedback is for this reason but be cordial and use different language depending on the audience.Absolutely raise this to your manager. If it‚Äôs affecting your work you shouldn‚Äôt just sit back and let it be. I was in a similar situation to you and it started affecting my mental health because the underperformer was constantly needing zoom calls and DMs explaining every little thing and it was pretty hard on me. I went to my manager finally after months and they asked why I didn‚Äôt bring it up sooner haha.If the feedback will be read to the actual person frame it more gracefully if you can. Managers even good ones sometimes miss when a person is weighing down the team. Let them know!;jk8auis;i3ldm;4jnrqzcl
I would say those things in an impartial unemotional manner.You dob't have to say anything but if you want to do your job well you should.If you're leaving why even give a shit either way?;jk8tjap;ukeubsd5;4jnrqzcl
Reviews should be factual and measurable. You have to provide concrete evidence of why the delivered quality is poor slow etc. These feedbacks are important but can‚Äôt be feeling based.;jk8xz5q;7krvtmha;4jnrqzcl
Check both ( human side ) motivation and ( technical side ) skills.Is he / she under a bad work environment/ bad personal situation?Does he / she match the technical skill and experience required for the job ?;jk8xq93;6sc8m;4jnrqzcl
Communicate more directly more than just hinting like straight up talk to them ask them what is going on and explain how their lack of progress affects the rest of the team and if they don't listen or care cause it's possible they are quiet quitting then go to your boss and give them what you have and they lost likely get fired.;jk98zp9;13wf5y;4jnrqzcl
I would suggest being diplomatically honest. Focus on specific actionable areas of improvement. But really take the time to highlight any positives.;jk9lp6h;vumnpz24;4jnrqzcl
Performance evals on your own peers. Wow. Tell me your leadership doesn‚Äôt know jack shit about the day to day without telling me your leadership doesn‚Äôt know jack shit. This sounds like a cheap way to take accountability off of the managers. You‚Äôre there to do your job. It‚Äôs the leader‚Äôs job to sort out people who can‚Äôt hack it.;jk9m74r;6q6vv50;4jnrqzcl
If the coworker aint trying at all to improve has made no progress and puts in minimum effort i would bring it up to your management in a negative way. Give the coworker a chance or two at least to address any issues. If they continue to slack fuck em they deserve it for making your job harder and will have to learn a lesson from it the hard way.;jk9ylsm;6ovnv;4jnrqzcl
Whenever I've given negative feedback it has never looked good on me. You'll be burned by the poor work they do or by not helping them enough or including them enough or being a team player etc. My strategy now is just to distance myself as much as possible. The further away you are the worse you'll get burnt by whatever they touch.;jka2ccz;7ldck0bq;4jnrqzcl
This guy is getting paid to be a monkey for his company but is taking it so seriously. If it doesn‚Äôt affect your job just say ‚Äúfine‚Äù and move on. You don‚Äôt own the company;jk8sisg;i6q4d80;4xk7pm5j
Also based on OP‚Äôs recent post history it appears they are working two remote jobs at the same time and hiding this fact from at least one of their employers‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a bit rich to be reporting on coworkers when their entire career appears to be built on deception.;jka028o;thbn8kto;4xk7pm5j
I think the line to walk here is do they keep coming to you for the same problem or every problem or do they actually seem to be learning and growing?If a less experienced engineer comes to me with pointed questions that aren't repeats from previous questions and shows they've actually tried to solve their problems so they can tell me what doesn't work or at least what they've tried? That I can get behind so long as they also look like they get better over time.However if they're coming to me with very trivial questions or the same questions over and over and seem to make little to no attempt to solve things for themselves and think I'll just pair with them to help them get their work done? That's not gonna sit well with me. I may try to engage a bit less and point them in a direction to see if they can manage the rest on their own but at some point I'm definitely going to mention these issues to my manager. You should be nice initially and ideally see if there's something your manager and/or the team could possibly do to help get them in a better spot but at some point they're definitely going to be a drag on productivity.;jk9coqn;4cl69;32nu9vwc
I'm looking to leave but I haven't secured a good offer yet. I'll be in the same company for the foreseeable future when this review will happen. And was only asking what to do for this review. Now I keep getting judged by randoms for giving some context to my question.;jkavt2r;4jnrqzcl;vfab1by8
He annoys you - but is that important enough to potentially destroy his well-being? Who cares. Are you HR or do you own the company? Probably not.I think if the only issue is he irks you and you‚Äôre leaving the company and you have no stake in how the team does ratting him out would be a really petty and malicious thing to do;jk8y3n9;ekcnruc4;ekcnruc4
I'm seeking to leave haven't secured my ticket out yet. I am very much tied to this company and I am only asking what to do in this situation that is going to happen in the foreseeable future.;jkaulye;4jnrqzcl;ekcnruc4
right I didn't leave any reviews on the last review session but I got a load of BS thankfully my manager was lucid enough to understand that these nitpicks were nothing of substance. Albeit it did put me off target on one goal.sometime I wonder why I keep being courteous to those people they lash out the moment they can talk anonymously.;jkaxtt2;4jnrqzcl;bom43yvg
I don‚Äôt see why everyone‚Äôs saying ignore it like the feedback wouldn‚Äôt be constructive.;jk94gv1;vopzyswr;i3ldm
But he literally said it does affect his job (needing to handhold etc).;jk94h7j;15ye3x8b;i6q4d80
In my case it‚Äôs probably a case of me being under-leveled or the engineer being over-leveled.I want the narrative to be the former rather than the latter.;jk9d0ia;32nu9vwc;4cl69
>I don‚Äôt see why everyone‚Äôs saying ignore itLife's rough. Unless my coworker is a complete asshat I'm not going to go out of my way to create problems for them.;jk9bhu3;vi7ty7i2;vopzyswr
well then he can just say no to it or accept its part of the job and do less on other parts;jk98svw;n0oxr;15ye3x8b
People will never ever be at the same knowledge level because people have different motivations brain power time etc.;jk9f1lj;81k0p0ia;n0oxr
"exactly so it might be worth it to spend time to bring that as close as possible even if it's ""slow""";jk9g3je;n0oxr;81k0p0ia
Waste of time. There‚Äôs always the team idiot if you can‚Äôt spot it in 5 minutes then it‚Äôs you.;jkagvp2;81k0p0ia;n0oxr
First of all I'm grateful for having a stable job in this job market but I can't help but wonder if I'm being underpaid. I'm currently have 2 YOE and work at a non-tech Fortune 500 company as a software developer. Right now I'm being paid 90k/year and I'm based in Los Angeles. I have my annual performance review coming up real soon so would love some insight to see how much of a raise is reasonable. Thanks!;13ivhkf;5wegzpvt;
The only way to know is to apply. Short answer is you can probably make more but you're not being grossly under payed. Depends on what you know how good you are at what you do etc . 2 yoe can look vastly different on two people.;jkbx1pz;6ucyr;5wegzpvt
Honestly just bummed I didn‚Äôt choose CS my freshman year but I just don‚Äôt want to spend an extra couple years in school because of that. Why might you be against learning code and programming on your own getting certifications internships projects while not being in CS.Do you disagree that employers only care that you get a bachelors?;13iq4h6;7f2llh5j;
The hard part is not knowing IT the hard part is earning an interview to demonstrate that you know IT. To earn that interview you need to be one of the top 10-15 candidates who applied for the position. This decision is normally based exclusively on your resume. Will you sort above people with solid IT degrees from respected universities?That is the hard part.;jkbaycv;1mhpr;7f2llh5j
Not going to lie I prefer working with those who have either a CS or math degree the most.Worst case scenario is what we're going through right now at my company: working with someone who went into law and they basically became the team lead by schmoozing talking a big game and being a diplomat.;jkbfvkj;ey8q4;7f2llh5j
Honestly if you pick other majors don't try getting into Tech. It's not worth it and it creates troubles to other CS-majored students.;jkc506h;bp16b1n;7f2llh5j
Employers only care that u can do the jobBut in the initial job search degree helps get foot in the door Also some employers do have a degree requirement. I'm sure exceptions can be made for exceptional candidates but that's the exception not the norm;jkb7zkf;bse6xatq;7f2llh5j
No one is ‚Äúagainst learning code and programming on your own‚Äù. The problem is you won‚Äôt get internships as a non-cs major and projects and certifications are borderline useless at demonstrating your ability to do a job.;jkbhsql;r64u9;7f2llh5j
"if you want to be a developer just switch to CS now your life will be much easier. Maybe the only exception would be if another 2 years of school would be 100k+ of additional debt. I went to a cheap school ;)";jkbps0f;53bpbucj;7f2llh5j
People do it a lot with other STEM degrees I hear.;jkbqq5d;ukeubsd5;7f2llh5j
this is just me personally but id prolly just lie and said i got a cs degree. youd be amazed and the things people do to lie/fluff up stuff on their resumeswouldnt be surprised if my post gets downvoted;jkc7mty;buq7nat;7f2llh5j
I have no technical background but I self-studied for 9 months as well as finishing coding bootcamp for 3 months. It's been tough to find a position right now but a lot of interviewers (especially JPMC) told me to get my AWS Associate Developer Certificate.Does having that certificate helps with my job search? If so how effective? Thank you for the input.;13invvc;xlw54;
Virtually every resume I see has some kind of cloud provider cert on it so take that for what you will.;jkasrfx;ijw1rfnx;xlw54
Also consider how many 4 year-degreed AWS engineers were recently laid off by Amazon. They are your competition in the market right now.;jkavlh2;1mhpr;xlw54
I'm guessing it helps but job offers won't land on your table just b/c of it;jkb8728;bse6xatq;xlw54
Can you give more information? What kinds of certs? Are these for senior or junior positions? Big tech/gov/no name?;jkb4chh;2uy3bjf5;ijw1rfnx
I already have something for this summer but I want to work during senior year fall semester and rather it be something to add to my resume. Anyone know any places that take fall interns remotely?;13imegz;5gxldbsy;
"So today I was having my biweekly meeting with my boss when a coworker of mine joined the call. I had asked my team member why he joined and they just said they knew me and my boss were talking and they wanted to know what we were discussing.My boss then (jokingly) said ""oh I was just telling David (me) they suck and I'm getting rid of him.""He then said that my teammate's turn was next.I'd like to write it off as a joke but the truth is I have been under performing. I have been dealing with a lot of mental health issues. I was hospitalized for depression in 2018. Since I have been in my role I have seen therapy done TMS and have even been on and off several psych meds. I think I've been getting better but I know I'm not quite where I should be given I've been in my role for almost two years now. I do still rely on my boss quite a bit.Even during our meeting my boss asked how id been doing health wise and I told him I think I've been getting better since I'm finally getting treated for low testosterone.Maybe I'm blowing this out of proportion but it really did hurt my feelings to hear my boss say that. He wouldn't have joked about it if there wasn't a kernel of Truth to it.I can understand being disappointed in my performance but hearing him talk about me like that even as a joke in front of my colleagues really does hurt. Especially when I've been open to my boss about dealing with diagnosed PTSD and even asking him before if he would recommend me looking for a role somewhere else in the firm. I really just want to know the most professional way to handle this. I have no desire to work in a place where I am the butt of comments like that";13ilnw9;3qg2ja1r;

>He wouldn't have joked about it if there wasn't a kernel of Truth to it.I don't think that's true at all. I can easily imagine a boss joking that way about a fine employee.The most professional way to handle this imo would be to develop a thicker skin.;jkaqumz;ukeubsd5;3qg2ja1r
>He wouldn't have joked about it if there wasn't a kernel of Truth to itYour boss definitely was crass and unprofessional but this plainly just isn't true. There are plenty of instances of jokes that are sarcastic and far from the truth.;jkag5jy;328doggt;3qg2ja1r
> Maybe I'm blowing this out of proportionAs a manager I would only make this joke when the person was definitely doing fine.The correct action is to not even care whether there's a kernel of truth in the joke. Ruminating on it is just your depression speaking.I know you are going to object to my suggestion that it's not worth even thinking about. That is also your depression speaking.;jkbwsd7;dmwxln9w;3qg2ja1r
If I were you I would go to an employment layer and pay the one hour fee for the best way how to approach your medical situation with HR. In some cases once you've reached out to HR **before** they performance improvement plan you it would make it super hard for them to fire you or PIP you without putting them at risk of discrimination. When done right it can protect your job precisely because you are under performing. I know things are hard and it's hard to push for something so far outside your comfort zone. But looking for new work in this economy and in your health would be way worse.  Suck it up for the several hundred bucks and get GOOD advice on how to secure your job. Mental health is no joke but you shouldn't feel ashamed about it either. You can of course also ask the same lawyer how to approach HR about the hurtful comments. The manager might just be a young bro who's not used to professionalism suitable for his role and using humour to hide his own discomfort. But don't go to HR unarmed and alone. They aren't there to help you. They're there to make sure the company doesn't get sued by your lawyer or your manager's lawyer.;jkcmg6s;1v1d;3qg2ja1r
>He wouldn't have joked about it if there wasn't a kernel of Truth to it.Not true. I had a manager who often joked about firing some of his best employees but it was because he thought it was obvious it was a joke. Never once did I hear them joke that way about anyone who was actually underperforming.That said I don't know you or your boss. But generally I live my life on the assumption that most people aren't (purposely) assholes.So my assumptions would be your boss only said it because they thought it was obvious it was a joke. That doesn't mean he was right to say it though.;jkanjn4;b7id4g6;3qg2ja1r
It‚Äôs actually more likely he made the joke because he‚Äôs happy with your performance than unhappy with it;jkb9ig9;4x2ii0sp;3qg2ja1r
Communication solves 99% of workplace issues. This situation is no different.There's actually 2 things going on here:1. Your boss made an insensitive joke that made you feel bad and you didn't appreciate it. This has nothing to do with how you're performing.2. You don't know if your boss thinks you're underperforming or not and are letting that get to your head leading you to make assumptions about how others are perceiving your performance that may or may not be true.Both can be solved by having a professional conversation with your manager.I would have a quick talk with him about how that whole situation made you feel. From your boss's perspective I bet they have no idea how that made you feel and if you brought it to their attention they'd apologize profusely and be more sensitive in the future. I know that's what I would do I'd feel horrible if something I said made someone else feel bad about themselves at work.If you don't say anything they don't know that their behavior was an issue and they're likely going to repeat that behavior in the future.So #1 should be dealt with. Which would naturally lead into you have further discussions about #2. Set aside the joke. Ignore that for now. Have a conversation to find out your boss's thoughts on your performance. If your performance is up to expectations or not should never be a mystery. Just because you're not at 100% doesn't mean you're not still meeting expectations. Having open candid conversations about performance/expectations is extremely important in both directions.As an aside not all jokes have a kernal of truth to it. Not even close. The very thing that makes many jokes funny is how absurdly and obviously *untrue* they are. Like joking about firing your *best* employee.;jkap49j;ubb8r7jp;3qg2ja1r
Stop over thinking it was just a joke;jkaqeu4;k9ke2t7;3qg2ja1r
I think you're just be being a tad sensitive and self critical. People often don't joke about those things if they are seriously considering termination or corrective action. He sounded seriously interested in your health and well being which it would be much more of a red flag if they were not. They might be inappropriately venting through humor but I don't know. I come from a construction background where thick skin is a requirement and you often build comraderie by insulting people basically lol.I read through your extra context. So basically you are underperforming to a critical degree and upset that your boss wants you to perform better? You're not happy with his behavior but you everyone needs to make accommodations for yours?;jkby882;8uf15z0z;3qg2ja1r
Why would your coworker get to know whatever you say during your ONE to ONE ? It's none of his business.;jkc08vq;4jnrqzcl;3qg2ja1r
I agree that sometimes humor doesnt mean exactly what they are saying eg irony. Maybe it would help if I gave more context:[https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12c9h0o/relationship\_with\_boss\_has\_become\_toxic\_openly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12c9h0o/relationship_with_boss_has_become_toxic_openly/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/wznpij/i\_dont\_want\_to\_lose\_my\_job/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/wznpij/i_dont_want_to_lose_my_job/);jkaozs1;3qg2ja1r;328doggt
thanks this is all great advice. I have reached out to HR before about getting a medical leave (which I didnt take). I'd like to think this doesnt demand a lawyer but I'll give it some thought. Thanks;jkdbvlm;3qg2ja1r;1v1d

even I'm not happy with my past performance. I have PTSD and depression and was on/off several meds. Crying in therapy every week and getting my brain zapped. I was in a bad place.I just dont appreciate jokes about me being fired in front of my coworkers when I've obviously been underperforming. It's threatening and it puts me on edge.I even asked him yesterday if he has seen an improvement in my performance as of recent and he told me he couldnt think of any issues;jkdci90;3qg2ja1r;8uf15z0z
Honestly yeah him dropping in was silly;jkdbxmp;3qg2ja1r;4jnrqzcl
People are giving you perfectly fine explanations to what happened. They don‚Äôt need more context. You need to accept that your boss was just joking instead of continuing to try and push this narrative that is only true in your head.I will reiterate the above comment. The statement is absurd and untrue. I would be happy he made a joke about firing you because in his head he has never even had the idea that he would have to fire you.;jkat10k;tmnerkzl;3qg2ja1r

Hello all I am 6 months into my current position and I was wondering things I can do to help stand out when recruiting season starts in a few months.By then I'll have the following certs:AWS Cloud PractionerAWS Solutions Architect (Associates)AWS Developer (Associates)I'll also have a file hosting project on AWS with React and GoLang with a complex list of features.Do you believe this would be enough to get a good amount of call backs? If not what else could I be doing over this summer to help get onto track?;13ih8kh;2uy3bjf5;
I do not believe that it is enough to get a lot of callbacks based on what you have said.  You might get a few but I would not think a lot.With AWS most employers just have their backend engineers learn AWS through ad hoc online research and don‚Äôt hire AWS specialists.I near as I can tell you should just dive deeper into your Golang learning and sell yourself as a Golang backend engineer or go to some startup that hires full stack engineers.;jk9y6e5;q40ylesy;2uy3bjf5
A resume with < 1 YoE is never going to stand out.;jkaazjc;ijw1rfnx;2uy3bjf5
You gotta stay and build experience because if you look for a new job now you'll just end up having the same job search because your qualifications haven't significantly changed in the past year. Sure more skills are helpful but under a year of experience is your main limiter.;jka59k9;do8xl;2uy3bjf5
It can stand out when in a pile of other <1 YoE resumes. I'm not being stupid and aiming for senior or even mid level I just want to stand out for entry/junior.;jkae512;2uy3bjf5;ijw1rfnx
It definitely is but this job is also paying quite low for my area so that is why I want to jump ship.;jka7ln0;2uy3bjf5;do8xl
And you are seemingly assuming it will at some point be found in a pile of other <1 YoE resumes.Let's hope it does and you het a cool job.;jkb8g0j;3ov1d;2uy3bjf5
I'm an aspiring front-end react developer taking the self-taught route. So far I've learned the fundamentals of HTML CSS and Javascript and now I'm in the process of working on projects to become more familiar with DOM manipulation before I move onto learning React. I'm currently working as a WFH sales rep for one of the big cell phone companies but I wanted to gravitate towards a tech job where I can utilize basic javascript in at least some form while learning the front-end skills to land a developer job outside of work. I understand that it may take me several months or even years before I'm ready for a junior role so I figured this would be good for my resume in the meantime.With my current skillset is this possible? And if so what sort of jobs should I look into?(And I apologize if I'm asking the wrong subreddit I rarely post.);13ie9hj;gszuj;
Hey hey try looking for roles in the application support space (level 2).You'll likely have exposure to code and have to escalate to developers as well. It's also a nature transition into a dev role from level 2/3 support especially at a SaaS company.;jk9cbar;1b70v1m0;gszuj
"If your goal is to get a developer position your current approach isn't really feasible nor is it very efficient. It's very difficult to find generalist jobs like the one you're describing where you can get by with just ""basic javascript"".If you're serious about becoming a developer you need to learn the basics yourself either with a degree bootcamp or self study.";jk9gxkr;t552q;gszuj
You could become a content guy if that's something you're interested in. I know one who transitioned to frontend dev eventually. Content ranges from just copy writing to being basically the webmaster of a small CMS site or blog. You'd want the later obviously.But if you can coast selling phones that'd be better. A good coasting job leaves more time for personal projects and studying.;jkai8hy;7s9qbgk00;gszuj
Thanks for the reply! Would this require me to learn some other languages and skills like SQL or would I be able to get hired with just Javascript?;jk9fp79;gszuj;1b70v1m0
"I'll second the SaaS company thing. I scored an interview for a phone job helping customers setup their sites when I was working as a CSR elsewhere before I became a dev. Their job ad IIRC had HTML mentioned right in it as ""helpful to know.""";jkaht2p;7s9qbgk00;1b70v1m0
100%. I am self-studying as I mentioned in the post. I was asking about if there are tech jobs that exist where I can put my current skills to use. My self-study is outside of work where I learn the skills I need for that developer role months or years down the line.Currently I have a sales job where I self-study outside of work. I'm asking in regards to a good tech job I can have while I continue my self-study outside of work.;jk9i4ut;gszuj;t552q
Depends on the role I've worked in level 2 roles where we used more SQL then the developers and I've worked in roles where all I needed was javascript and knowledge of how to debug api calls.Learning SQL is never going to hurt it'll always generally come in handy throughout your career;jk9h8ay;1b70v1m0;gszuj
> I was asking about if there are tech jobs that exist where I can put my current skills to use.If your asking whether or not there are jobs that use sales skills and basic javascript skills there definitely are. Roles like technical sales exist. However what I think you're actually asking for is a non-developer position that teaches you developer skills the answer is unlikely.;jkahvdk;t552q;gszuj
Awesome! I'll take a look into this thank you for your time.;jk9izh7;gszuj;1b70v1m0
Hello I'm a sales engineer looking to advance my career and I've noticed that many of the positions I'm interested in applying for are looking for experience with SQL. I did a bit with it in college but definitely have some learning to do. Personally I've had a lot of success with Duolingo for Spanish language learning because it a) reminds me daily to engage with the app and b) it gamifies my learning. Are there any apps or websites out there that do something similar for SQL or programming languages? Thanks!;13i7d08;m6tluu;
I‚Äôve been using Codecademy Go to learn js - it‚Äôs not quite as gamefied as Duolingo but it‚Äôs a mobile app that encourages you to do small coding tasks daily;jk8f9sj;36owc721;m6tluu
Not an app  but I suggest learn the Entity-Relationship model and Relational Algebra before SQL.A lot of developers jump straight to SQL that's why they find it difficult...;jk8jijs;6sc8m;m6tluu
leetcode;jk8sxy6;ukeubsd5;m6tluu
SQL isn‚Äôt hard. The free problems on leetcode would suffice. IMO it helps a lot to look into data modeling and query execution mechanics at least a bit before starting to write queries. But most folks don‚Äôt bother with that.;jk8vg1b;2tu8n7l9;m6tluu
I think freecodecamp has some quiz stuff;jk99eu5;3fjhzh55;m6tluu
Sololearn app is what you‚Äôre looking for;jkawmp8;ct2zfsl1;m6tluu
I've been applying for quite some time now and have lost traction during the pandemic. I'm a good candidate with 3YoE and stuff that people are looking for. Would a cover letter really make that much of a difference in my chances of getting a job? Or at least a damn interview;13ioliy;6c8kcp9;
Nay;jkaw1yd;m0oig;6c8kcp9
Writing them does not hurt you in any way unless you say something dumb.  Help is up in the air.  You should just do what you think is worth your time and let things fall out as they may.  There are no guarantees in job hunting.;jkay0mc;fb1k3;6c8kcp9
"I used to say ""no"" to cover letters because I thought it was a waste of time. In this job market though anything you can do to scratch and claw your way ahead is worth it. That means cover letter re-writing resumes etc. If you're desperate for a job.If you are just poking around then do whatever you want.";jkb023p;9b0ek;6c8kcp9
Most people seem to hold little to no stock with them others create a new one tailored to every job - I have a generic one that I only change the job title on and that's it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è;jkb6oql;dfmuc;6c8kcp9
i‚Äôve never heard back from a company that i sent my chatgpt cover letters to. waste of time imo;jkbjqn3;4x38ylbv;6c8kcp9
They can't hurt and some places consider them table-stakes.So I'd probably send ChatGPT a few bullet points about yourself and why you're interested in the position and have it generate a cover letter that you edit lightly. Adds 15 minutes of work per application but might increase your chances a bit.Edit: also greatly depends on where you're applying. FAANG probably doesn't care but smaller and/or old fashioned company might.;jkbdd70;dehayf68;6c8kcp9
When I used them I found it made no differenceMaybe my cover letters just sucked;jkb82o0;bse6xatq;6c8kcp9
Cover letters are outdated. They were a practice in the stone age before smart phones email applauded and used by boomers. Absolute waste of time when its gen x and millenials who are now doing the interviewing and hiring.;jkbadac;6ovnv;6c8kcp9
Waste of time and can some times hurt. I‚Äôve seen resumes thrown out because of cover letters with typos or someone forgetting to update their template and having another company‚Äôs name in it.;jkbkasg;9mjqrbva;6c8kcp9
nay;jkbmufl;ldg07n4v;6c8kcp9
ive always said yay because its a good way of assessing many of the characteristics of a candidate that wont show in a resume like soft skills. Is the candidate proactive ambitious service and commercially minded a good communicator a good team player? It's hard to tell from a resume but from a cover letter you can get a decent grasp of this. Theres plenty of candidates with good resumes out there that are completely oblivious to these things and wouldn't even be able to figure out what employers want to hear. These things can be the difference between an excellent candidate and a terrible candidate. I have put effort into it and it's had great effect in my application process but I know that many employers out there are so sick of reading shitty cover letters that they question wether its worth it. But in many instances id  trade technical skills for soft skills. Im going to spend most of my day with these people and I don't want to spend it with grumpy and difficult people that has to be micromanaged. A less technical well functioning team is more productive than a technically skilled dysfunctional team. With chatgpt Im not so sure it can be used like that anymore probably not unfortunately.;jkbztjt;aunsom2t;6c8kcp9
Nay indeed;jkb5tlk;4zzjxc2d;m0oig
Just have ChatGPT write it. But then again I'm too lazy to do that too. So nay as well;jkc6xsi;9r2rs1bfv;m0oig

My main objective is studying for interviews and also refreshing on foundational knowledge. My main language is Java and I work mostly in the backend. What book/textbook do you think is the best for studying for interviews and beyond? I‚Äôm not talking about coding portion as I think Cracking the Coding Interview is the best for that but general software development knowledge. Let‚Äôs discuss.;13inpnf;x54ur;
">My main objective is studying for interviews and also refreshing on foundational knowledge.These are two different goals. One is ""studying to pass the test"" and the other is ""understanding the material."" You won't find a ""best programming book"" that does both of these. Nor is there a single ""best"" book about anything.";jkaywzk;etdsy;x54ur
I don't know how other people will feel about this opinion but:IMO most books are full of fluff repeat themselves often are almost all out of date and often don't align well with your goals.It may be better to find some example interviews or read some concise articles describing interviews. Subsequently follow the specific topics that those articles discuss in more details in the areas where you are weak.Perhaps I'm wrong.;jkat2eq;ggbx5;x54ur
This is an odd recommendation but How To Solve It by Polya helped me the most (admittedly I haven't read many other programming/math books)So the book itself is related to math problem solving but I found the steps overlap greatly with LC/coding problem solving;jkb8fcb;bse6xatq;x54ur
The Philosophy of Software Design if you're trying to write clean code. Very practical advice that have helped me find the right abstractions. Deep modules over shallow modules defining out errors and edge cases handling the default cases etc. are such game changers to me.;jkbhi5s;ey8q4;x54ur
I left my job as a full stack developer in november after my prior company used a sequence of aborted launches to extend crunch hours for a full month and a half. Immediately thereafter Meta Twitter Google and all those other companies layed of thousands of their workers. Six months later I'm still out of work and recruiters are constantly asking me what I've been doing since then.I've been saying I've been working on my second novel (which is true) but with opprtunities drying up and many companies giving me rejection emails without an interview I'm worried companies are seeing the gap and just throwing my resume in the trash.Is this the case or is web development as a whole so suitably fucked that I need to switch careers this instant?;13igydy;bp207;
"Depends how you frame it.I interviewed (passed) with a 'resume gap explainer' type and I just upfront told him what I was doing instead and spun it to make me look good.DIY gardening passion projects upskilling or just taking time to recharge (so you won't do it during work ;\] ) are all good reasons. In academia they call it a sabbatical haha.Plus you can be lax with timelines and turn that 1 week dabble into a 4 week project to look even better. As long as you build the rapport and come off looking competent do you.";jk9vllw;vkxdfwmh;bp207
No it only really starts to come up around 1 year of unemployment.But really the only reason that any amount of unemployment is a red flag is because they are concerned that (1) you might be rusty (2) your skills might be out-of-date or (3) you might have forgotten how to program.  If your resume believably presents reasons why you are not rusty your skills are totally up-to-date (or cutting edge) and you are regularly programming no amount of unemployment is of any concern to most employers.;jk9r2n4;q40ylesy;bp207
Make up a lie like you are doing OMSCS.;jkas73x;ukeubsd5;bp207
focus most of your effort towards getting a job. Like don't overdue the novel at the expense of your the job search. You don't need to extend your unemployment any longer than it has to be.  I'm not sure that anything beyond 'i've been looking for a job' is needed as an excuse in the current job environment? Everybody knows there's issues in the market.;jkcf5en;53bpbucj;bp207
I've heard people argue that they've signed a NDA could that cover for this scenario?;jk9sbpi;gc3nyh76;q40ylesy
"With a 6 month unemployment gap I think the main factor is more of a lemming effect - no one really thinks you forgot how to program in 6 months but they do think ""if this person were any good someone would have hired them by now."" The concerns you mentioned are definitely real but I think they're more common after a year or multiple years of unemployment.With that in mind I think it can be useful to include some indication of what you've been up to on your resume just to avoid making it look like you've been consistently applying and getting rejected for the last 6 months. Once you've gotten past the resume screen I don't think it really matters any plausible answer is fine.";jk9x4u8;2da9zk4c;q40ylesy
It would depend on the NDA but usually you can reveal that who you worked for how long you worked for them the general kind of work and what skills you used there.;jk9w8nz;q40ylesy;gc3nyh76
I agree with your second paragraph but not your first.But perhaps job seekers might imagine a ‚Äúlemming effect‚Äù from their perspective: they imagine that they are losing jobs due to unemployment when it is a different reason like they are simply not competitive with other candidates.;jk9zu6g;q40ylesy;2da9zk4c
I have been seeing a lot of openings in the European countries (remote) i applied for a lot but couldn't even get an interview or pre-screening assessment. Is there anything that i can do to increase my chances or just suffer. Thank you PS: i only have ~1 year experience if that matters;13ieh4p;tocqguge;

Junior transfer majoring in Applied Math with a minor in CS. Which of these courses what be best to take alongside by upper div courses? Thanks! https://imgur.com/gallery/sdQhCkR;13iq1fu;poc4v;
My 2 cents having run a data science team for a few years -- specifically one that partnered with data science / ML resources at many different academic and grant-funded research shops. It's not gospel just opinions.All of the energy you're spending on course selection? Divert it to getting in tight with a reputable research lab or an internship. Get experience working with real-world data and real-world problems not carefully curated and crafted Kaggle datasets and tinker-toy problems. Flip a series of coins among your options of upper division courses. If you already have a background in applying mathematics to a particular domain -- economics diagnostic medicine GIS cognition human development whatever -- pick the course most complementary to whatever domain you wish to apply mathematics to. If you don't know what sort of industry or problem space you'd like to work within pick the course most likely to expose you to as many different sectors/industries/problems as possible.;jkb9zh1;eyj9u;poc4v
Hmm thanks for sharing that perspective. I might just do that where instead of trying to cram a bunch of different CS electives into my coursework I'll try looking at some of the other quantitative courses my school offers. I appreciate the advice.;jkbd2kp;poc4v;eyj9u

I‚Äôve been a software engineer for 2 years now and I‚Äôm on ¬£35k (based in the UK). Is this the salary you would expect someone with 2 years of experience to get? Or should I perhaps move companies. My current one is very strict with pay-rise people have only got a 2% raise. So I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm getting underpaid or if it is fair.;13ip4em;chabtr3c;
Holy cow‚Ä¶ thank god I don‚Äôt work out of the UK your salary is my yearly bonus no flex here. Might wanna move to the US;jkaxlb7;5ol3l6sn;chabtr3c
you pretty much just have to go get offers from other companies to determine what you are worth. Otherwise there's really no way to know.;jkcflgf;53bpbucj;chabtr3c
I know haha it‚Äôs the gutters in the UK when it comes to salary‚Ä¶ some doctors earn less than this so that tells you about the state of this country :(;jkaxuk4;chabtr3c;5ol3l6sn
Well at least you got free healthcare ü§ß I‚Äôd suggest googling how much an SDE makes at a MANGA company in the UK with the same years of experience then using it as reference. Ideally you shouldn‚Äôt be more than 20% lower than that;jkay9ob;5ol3l6sn;chabtr3c
you can't use that as a reference that pay is so much higher than median pay. The levels are also kind of weird. Senior devs at other companies commonly start at SDEII at Amazon for example.;jkcfp6b;53bpbucj;5ol3l6sn
I'm a new grad going to be working in defense working on a flight simulator using C++11 primarily. I would say I'm an intermediate with C++ I used it a lot in college but nothing too fancy. Ideally I would like to transition out of defense at some point in the near future and go somewhere where I can continue to use at least some of the skills I gained and get paid more. What skills/areas should I become knowledgeable in to stand out to tech or trading/fintech companies that use C++? Those of you who use C++ what kind of stuff do you work on? What are some good resources to learn?;13ik6ye;100wjq;
You‚Äôll gain experience writing large scale systems in c++ on the job. I wouldn‚Äôt sweat it too much.  Look into what the jobs you want have listed in the requirements and work towards that goal. Luckily with c++11 you‚Äôll be writing in the more modern paradigms so that‚Äôs good experience.;jkanhe7;3u84d;100wjq
Is c++11 prevalent in the industry? I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was modem or not considering there‚Äôs 1417 and 20;jkatcfr;100wjq;3u84d
11 introduced smart pointers lambdas and move. Those are some of the more important parts of modern c++.  11 probably isn‚Äôt as widely used anymore compared to 17 but the language hasn‚Äôt really changed as significantly as 11.;jkbva2y;3u84d;100wjq

I am evaluating issue trackers for my team while considering things like integration usability etc‚Ä¶ Jira is off the table because of reasons. Wondering y‚Äôall‚Äôs thoughts.;13icyxq;pcq82;
"> considering things like integration usability etc‚Ä¶That's why too vague to give a good opinion.  Any advice you get is going to be general we use X and haven't had any problems level of answers.   You need to define what your ""requirements"" are for a tool.  When you understand what you are looking for then you can look at your options.  You should get demos a each tool you are considering and see how they meet your requirements.  Maybe there is no existing tool that is a perfect match so then you have too look at where you can be flexible. For example you say integration but to what?  YouTrack may be awful to integrate with tool X but you don't use tool X so it does not matter within your evaluation.Usability means different things to different people.  Define what you mean by usability as part of your requirements. For example I've seen a lot of tools where it's easy to enter things but then managing and triaging things you have entered are a pain in the ass.  Understand who your primary users are going to be for the tool within your SDLC.  Are managers going to want to generate reports out of the tool?  Are there going to be expectations of creating templates so certain data is always required within each issue?  These are somethings you should understand going in to a demo so you can see how it actually works.";jk9aun4;fb1k3;pcq82
"Wait why is a new grad deciding what issue tracker your team is using? Does your company not have a standard choice already? If your manager or team lead told you to find one they should've given you a list of requirements not just ""integration usability and not Jira""";jk9t4ha;do8xl;pcq82
Of course there‚Äôs ability to problem solve but what else? What do you rate as a quality or skill in yourself or others that makes someone good at a cs job?;13icfb6;t8i3l3lk;
Visualization and research are super important. When you have a ton of independent pieces that need to work together it's helpful if you can mentally map out the path that data or whatever takes. So if you have a bug you might be able to guess where the error actually occurs. Research is also important just because you can't know everything and even double checking your assumptions will save a lot of pain later on.Something that's a little underrated would be communication skills. Not just for talking to coworkers but in your code and documentation. By being able to convey information in a clear and concise way you reduce the chance of someone using that code incorrectly and speed up any future bug fixes or feature enhancements;jk93jbz;do8xl;t8i3l3lk
The ability to learn independently and quickly.  It is very important to be able to teach yourself new things.  You will never have enough time with your seniors leads or mentors to learn everything you need to know to be a good Software Engineer.  Also don‚Äôt stop once you learned enough to implement the solution.  Go deeper to learn how it works.  Once you have a solid understanding it will accelerate future learning as well.  Tough at the beginning but this is a skill that you need to practice just like anything else.;jk9he9a;15aso3dv;t8i3l3lk

Ouch :( https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/05/15/you-studied-computer-science-but-big-tech-no-longer-wants-you-now-what;13inq6e;7mbvd7di;

"I mean... there are economic cycles  2 years ago back in 2021 would have been ""you studied computer science but 5 big tech all wants you now what?""";jkbf6i9;11hljx;7mbvd7di
your odds aren't that great even in a good economy to get into big tech. So you shouldn't only be studying CS solely to get into big tech.  I consider myself pretty smart. I had nearly perfect grades in a competitive STEM degree taught myself programming and currently make good money have done quite a lot of interview prep and have tried a few times and the furthest I got was the FAANG onsite so far.;jkbml6h;53bpbucj;7mbvd7di
"I mean this is normal. Supply and demand.California gold rush was the exact same.The first ones got huge benefits then screamed about gold being in California.Then other people kept joining. And it became more and more difficult to find gold.Ironically it was during this time more and more people would join for the gold rush.There's quite a delay in-between getting the message out to the next generation that the field is over flooded with candidates.People here seem to think this field is immune to the world of economics. While tech will be here to stay it is not infinite at any finite point in time. I could claim 'medical improvements will be here to stay so there's endless jobs.' While the former is true the latter isn't. Imagine if everyone decided to become doctors (and med schools accepted all these applicants). Now doctors become a commodity and not really valuable to the job market. This is independent of the fact that doctors are necessary and will keep being necessary in a functioning society.&#x200B;This happens to every career. I think it's common acceptance at this point that the number of CS graduates and aspiring CS graduates worldwide far exceeds supply of entry developer roles. CS grads are basically a dime a dozen at this point and this trend will get more and more extreme in the near future. Supply and demand will then dictate how the labour market works.At least the example was of a graduate from Berkeley. That's one of the best universities in CS.  As CS becomes more popular name of your school will matter more and more for the first job. The notion of 'anyone can break into tech' was only true because there were lack of graduates from traditional pathways. As competition arises requirements rises. Look at accounting. Back in the day you could do accounting out of high school. Now you need to get an accounting degree. Software development will most likely take a similar path over time. Then you look at finance and start realizing at some point the threshold becomes by college brand names because there's just too many applicants. All this is normal.";jkausd1;z8knubb;7mbvd7di

You should diversify your skill sets as a human being. I can always go back to welding for 70K a year but in a country with scam healthcare it's not viable to do day in and day out. Specialization into one specific career means you are at the mercy of the careers' demands always. I want to know how to develop apps so I can clock 6 figures when the market is hiring zombies off the street as SWE and when the tech cycle is down I'll just go back to being paid below the neck if I don't survive the layoffs. My entire class in a CS300 unit has the same story. I work in X field but I want to get paid more and work remotely. Most of them will not be hired when there is a large pool of laid-off experienced juniors who have a network and already working on personal projects to showcase in their spare time. Hell I'm one of those people who will most likely not be hired until the market is dying for new blood.;jkc7ttw;8uf15z0z;7mbvd7di

It's funny to see that as AI gets better and better it will disrupt many white collar jobs. I'm wondering how these ML engineers researchers or even SWEs that work with AI feel about working on AI technologies that can potentially take away their own jobs if it becomes more advanced? Isn't it ironic that engineers are building super intelligent systems that they have built themselves can take away their own jobs and humanity one day?;13iu3q0;6qcaiyz0;
So far it seems to be a totally unproven claim about the far future mostly promoted by idiots.;jkbqgdy;ukeubsd5;6qcaiyz0
Get paid;jkbqai5;57xmr3fu;6qcaiyz0
No one working on AI actually believes AI is going to take over programming jobs. The people saying that are either people who directly gain profit from marketing the capabilities of their AI or they're over hyped tech bros with no actual knowledge on the subject.In our lives i doubt AI will ever be more than a tool to assist actual human programmers.The promises of AI feel an awful lot like the promises of autonomous vehicles. And this brand of over hyped overly optimistic futurism goes back a long time. Our parents were told of flying cars and colonies on the moon. But as always the real world and real life limits tend to bring us down to earth eventually.;jkc762a;5pjfo0im;6qcaiyz0
They probably think it‚Äôll make them a lot of money and then the economic disruption just won‚Äôt be their problem anymore.  Human beings are inherently pretty selfish at the end of the day so it doesn‚Äôt surprise me that they‚Äôd be fine working on things that will wreck the livelihoods of millions of people.Some are probably also naive enough to not realize that‚Äôs a likely outcome of what they‚Äôre doing.  Maybe they (also naively) believe that they‚Äôre helping to usher in a better future for humanity when the reality is that we will probably just end up with Feudalism 2: Electric Boogaloo.;jkbrpe0;1279xa;6qcaiyz0
It is what it is;jkbq084;j7i1d;6qcaiyz0
Software engineers have been trying to automate their own jobs ever since the first assembler was created. From assemblers to compilers to IDEs to all the modern frameworks and development tooling software engineers have always been trying to abstract away the low-level stuff so they can focus on the high-level problems. So in that sense trying to automate one's own job is nothing new for this field. But thus far having fancy tooling hasn't reduced the need for developers. It just increases the expectations for how much output one developer can produce.At this point it still remains to be seen whether AI will finally be the thing that actually kills the profession or whether it will be just another tool in the toolbox which causes the profession to evolve but not go away. There are probably a lot of AI developers who believe the latter. Those who believe the former probably just hope the day will be far enough away that it won't be their problem any more.;jkbs1z7;k2uqykv;6qcaiyz0

It most definitely will not in the next 50 years come close to killing the profession. Make programmers more efficient and transform a part of their workflow? Sure but I don‚Äôt expect a lot more for a long time.;jkcanq5;d1jqy714;k2uqykv
Can I buy 15 AIs for 3 FTTs?;jkbsfq8;ukeubsd5;1279xa
As a developer I certainly hope that the profession won't go away anytime soon but I also don't think anyone can say with confidence what will happen in 50 years. 50 years ago the internet was in its infancy just an experimental research project. There were no websites no email. 50 years is an eternity in tech and enough time for some massive transformations.Whatever happens I'm just going to enjoy the ride.;jkcc2up;k2uqykv;d1jqy714

I joined a start up company two months ago. The start up company was founded by my friend and his girlfriend. We are a total of five (3 devs 1 business 1 designer) in the company and we are all in college.I am thinking of resigning because I am losing interest in the work they give me. I initially applied for a software engineer position and I told them that I specialize in the back-end. During the interview they asked me it would be okay for me to explore other aspects such as mobile app development. I said yes.We recently joined a Hackathon long story short it's basically a convention where different startups create a system within two weeks and pitch it to investors. I feel bad if I would resign now and leave my friend hanging.Now they are making me create an AI algorithm for our system and I have trouble accomplishing the task because of my lack of expertise in that particular subject.I am losing interest because I find AI difficult. In addition to the decline of interest is that they don't pay me nor have they allotted any equity. I admit it is also my fault because I did not ask those questions during the interview. I was naive because I did not prepare well as it is my first time joining a company or startup. I have not signed any documents or paperwork from the beginning. If I ever resign from the job would it be wise if I become their shareholder? Also how do I exit gracefully without burning bridges? I would love to hear your thoughts.;13i9xqi;goxpwla;
You don't work there you're just someone working for free on another person's project. Yes you should *resign* because it's not actually a job and you have no interest in the work. >If I ever resign from the job would it be wise if I become their shareholder?They aren't going to give you equity **after** you resign but that's fine they aren't going to go anywhere anyway.>Also how do I exit gracefully without burning bridges?Why do you even care about keeping this bridge open? Do you think they are actually going to succeed where so many other start-ups fail?;jk8r21p;328doggt;goxpwla
Resign? Bro you don't work there.;jk8s1ll;bw7mr;goxpwla
> In addition to the decline of interest is that they don't pay me nor have they allotted any equity.You are not an employee you are a volunteer.;jk8ukie;tfid7;goxpwla
Working for a friend = big red flag.If I were you I would keep working for resume and experience but set a boundary with them there is a limit of what you can do. Also at some points if they don't pay you any money you need to demand them to pay with internal stocks a.k.a become a shareholder. Give them a deadline of how much longer you will work for them for free (1-3 months) so they can have time to find your replacement. Also that way they will have an incentive to pay you.The longer you let them trample you the harder they will trample you.;jk8thpj;2jvyhe6o;goxpwla
If you aren't paid then leave. Tell them you're not interested in the work. You're not nearly important enough to burn bridges by resigning. You can't even 'resign' if you aren't being paid ffs.;jk8rcda;ukeubsd5;goxpwla
If you‚Äôre employee number 5 then you should get equity before writing a line of code. That‚Äôs how it works ‚Äúwe pay you nothing at first BUT if we make it big you get rich‚Äù. Without that second part you‚Äôre just a friend duped for free work. You literally owe these guys less than nothing as they should owe YOU money for whatever hours worked already.Edit: I don‚Äôt care what they say there‚Äôs no world in which you get properly taken care of after a first big round of funding. As soon as equity becomes valuable they‚Äôre not going to want to give it up.;jk8skjl;afq1k;goxpwla
Friends don‚Äôt exploit labor from friends.;jk934j9;40j8xe4u;goxpwla
Stay there until the end. They trust you and that's more important than money!;jk998om;bp16b1n;goxpwla
Wtf dude they are USING you! Lol. since you didn't sign anything grab all the code and data and quit. And start your own shit with that or use it as a reference for getting a different job.;jk90wll;ff2g1;goxpwla
"The adult way to handle this would be to tell your friend you'd like to have a chat about your participation in the company Bring a list of your concerns But it should be face to face if possible You can say exactly what you just said here ""Hey this is not for me I want to bounce but don't want to leave you guys hanging etc.""You should not commit to anything at that meeting ""Ok I will think about it""Because you need time to process the conversation and decide if it's good for you in the long run Tell him you will let him know by the end of the week If there is any untoward pressure to keep you working for free it is likely you are being used and should consider that going forward Open direct communication setting expectations all that is very important and you have already learned some things by getting involved which is good In future interviews you want to be able to talk about this experience in a positive way so you should do your best to handle it professionally like an adult Even if the other side is not acting professionally or ethnically Tho on the whole in the future it is not likely to matter at all unless your friends are vindictive and selfish etc";jk94zbk;3fjhzh55;goxpwla
"Wait so let me get this straight: you're working for free? I don't even think ""resigning"" is the right word because that assumes you have an actual job. This just seems like some project you guys are doing. I would definitely put this under ""projects"" but not ""experiences"" since you're not even getting paid. Get an actual job.";jk98nfq;7sr4yywx;goxpwla
Do you even get paid?Nevermind that was a TL:DR question. You don‚Äôt even work for them. Their company doesn‚Äôt exist and it‚Äôs just college people messing around. Move on.;jk991w2;11u0pb;goxpwla
"Friends don't put fake businesses before friends. They sounds like rich kids whose only role models in life were their exploitative workaholic parents. Having had ""friends"" like these myself the best succor I can give is burn that bridge as soon as possible. It's a one way bridge.";jk9pa0q;n32aqqy5;goxpwla
Friend bridge prob;jk8rsea;hpkwv;328doggt
>Why do you even care about keeping this bridge open? Because my colleagues are enrolled in some of the prestigious colleges in my country I thought keeping their connections would help me in my career.;jk8s92s;goxpwla;328doggt
well they aren't helping your career;jk8tshe;12pi3o;goxpwla
I guess just talk to them then. Tell them you're looking to move onto different things and see what they want from you. Decide if it's reasonable and go from there.;jk8u5hx;328doggt;goxpwla
"Your ""colleagues""? It's not a company. There's no employment contract. Also being connected to a prestigious university as a student doesn't mean dick.";jk95u8w;11l285;goxpwla
This is a lesson I learned when I started a business in college with my friend. Make sure the process of  gaining equity for what work you do is clearly defined. A buyout agreement or what happens when somebody wants to leave the company and sell their shares is also extremely important. Having a predefined process like this the next time you help start a business will be helpful. I would say never start a business with friends as my bridge was burnt with my partnership after an unequal amount of work was being put in. But I am starting one with a friend now which has these put into place so I feel much more comfortable about the future of our friendship.;jk9amfr;jlgqf;goxpwla
So I am not passionate about computers or networks or anything technological but I want to go into a field with job security which I feel like IT has a lot of. I have no clue what niche I want either - just plan to attend WGU to get my bachelor‚Äôs in computer science. I‚Äôm wondering how hard it will be to learn and go into this field with zero experience and zero passion for the topic. Has anyone else been in the same scenario? How long did it take you to graduate and how much time did you spend weekly studying? How did you decide what area you wanted to study further/work in?;13ih2jg;tw31p;
"My observation is that people who got into the CS field with ""zero passion for the topic"" didn't stick with it for very long and were unhappy while doing it even if they were making good money. Some performed poorly or had a poor attitude and found themselves getting placed on a PIP. Most moved on to other careers that they liked more. Often this was some type of management or into system or security administration.";jk9y4i3;is2izcr;tw31p
I guess if you‚Äôre not passionate you will need to  evaluate if you have the drive and perseverance to power through it day in and day out. It‚Äôs not just like get degree -> get well paid job. You‚Äôll have to prepare for getting a job which is difficult in the foreseeable future - that means coding prep and projects. It will mean a large number of resume drops and interviews. And then you‚Äôll need to keep your job which means learning whatever technologies the employer is using and also learning about new technologies as the landscape shifts. Inevitably you probably won‚Äôt stay at your first job for your entire career which means repeating this cycle a few more times.;jk9yr17;8y9kaxy;tw31p
Don't do a job you have zero passion in. CS is a field where you have to push yourself and constantly learn new technologies. If you hate it now before even starting you will either drop out or graduate and not last long. In either case you'll have wasted months and tons of money on the degree.;jk9s2h4;2uy3bjf5;tw31p
"I feel like theres a lot of jobs that have job security outside of computer science; even trade school if that‚Äôs your flavor. Going into compsci with no passion for it will be tiring and possibly lead to burnout‚Ä¶ I love computers and have a degree in computer engineering and still the degree was hard and the job mundane. If I were doing this with no interest I‚Äôd probably hate myself. I‚Äôm just starting to figure out where my interests lie in this field due to my passion for it and being able to explore different areas professionally and personally. If you want to come in with no passion or desire but just chasing the bag then look into what pays the highest and go for it.";jka0pzx;hedle;tw31p
Maybe it'd be worth exploring something like /r/learnprogramming or something else similar to toe the water a little. I'm no psychologist but having 0 passion for something doesn't sound like a good thing to pursue as a degree that might cost a lot of money nor as something you'd be doing ~40/hrs a week.---I'm not strongly passionate about computer science or programming but I also don't hate it. It's just merely a tool to solve problems ... that problem solving is what I actually enjoy (and to the same extent working with others to solve problems together and helping others get better at solving problems too).;jk9tlaw;isznhznw;tw31p
I think a lot of people have little to no previous coding experience.Would you arbitrarily decide to go to music school if you had no experience playing an instrument and no desire to learn anything about music? It's about that level of dumbness. But I have worked with people who did it and seemed relatively fine.;jkas3so;ukeubsd5;tw31p
I don‚Äôt hate it - I am just not passionate about it - I‚Äôm not passionate about anything. Considering that if I‚Äôm going to be miserable regardless I may as well be miserable in a field with a lot of job security. So yeah my mind is pretty set on the computer science degree I‚Äôm just curious other peoples‚Äô experiences entering the field with no passion or vested interest.;jk9t3xl;tw31p;2uy3bjf5
I don‚Äôt really enjoy working with physical materials so trades are out for me. I understand that it will be difficult especially without having a lot of interest in it. I think I‚Äôd likely encounter burnout in any profession though and ideally if I‚Äôm going to be burnout I want to be well paid as well. Good advice in looking for which area is best paid.;jka2rk9;tw31p;hedle
Unfortunately my passion has a low earning cap and I do not wish to pursue a career in that field. I like being on computers and using the computer so that along with job security is why I‚Äôm going to pursue a computer science degree. The school I‚Äôm attending is only around $16000 so even if I score an entry level position for 1-3 years I will be able to pay off my education. It‚Äôs less than ideal to spend 40 hours doing something that isn‚Äôt necessarily interesting to me but it‚Äôs gotta be a step up from retail/food/clerical work which I‚Äôm currently qualified for.;jk9w0qv;tw31p;isznhznw
If music was a lucrative and stable career yes I would go without having interest. I'm trying to pay my bills comfortably I can pursue my creative interests outside of work.;jkcp0kv;tw31p;ukeubsd5
Well everyone I know who didn't have much passion for the field either dropped out or gave up trying to get the first job (if this is your first time on this sub it is rough and grueling). So they wasted months/years and tens of thousands of dollars.;jk9tjkz;2uy3bjf5;tw31p
Thing is if you don't have passion to push through complexity and new challenges you won't have this perceived 'job security'. You'll be an average or below developer and that's where the stack ranking dragons be. Being a developer is very difficult sometimes and having NO passion is like a debuff that'll add +100% to all burnout damage. IMO at least.;jk9yum9;bv41z;tw31p
Even though you might hate learning to play an instrument and hate playing an instrument professionally and might be pretty bad at it too?;jkd7gqu;ukeubsd5;tw31p
I never said I hated IT.;jkd8fvc;tw31p;ukeubsd5
I didn't say that you did.I'm saying that you might discover that you can't stand programming since you just said you have no experience with it.;jkd9c38;ukeubsd5;tw31p
Unfortunately I don‚Äôt really like anything. It took me 12 years to figure that out as well so now I‚Äôm just trying to enter a field where there will always be jobs.;jkdc0la;tw31p;ukeubsd5
Imagine you just graduated with your shiny CS degree and have started working full-time at a tech company using xyz stack.If you stay at your current company for 3 years you'll have 3 YoE under your belt by the end of that period.Now let's say you're actually employed part-time instead of full-time. In 3 years will you have 3 YoE or 1.5?Now let's say (bear me with here) you're actually working two full-time jobs with the same tech stack at the same time.By the end of 3 years ignoring the feelings the recruiter may have about you working two jobs at the same time do you have 3 years or 6 years of experience?Lastly if you're in the camp of people who think part-time work cuts the YoE in half but you don't think working two full-time jobs doubles your YoE why is that so?;13ilpwd;3zrf5of7;
YOE are generally flexible.But I do have two arguments for why you cannot double it by working 2 jobs.1. Doing 2x as many junior level tasks doesn't actually help grow your skills past a junior level effectively2. As your skills grow so does the time for your mistake to materialize. Like I wrote a service design doc a couple months back and I'm sure in a couple years I'll be cursing myself for some of the decisions I made. However I need clock time to pass business needs to change scaling to happen etc. Me working more has a very small affect on the time for my mistakes to materialize.;jkai87b;b7id4g6;3zrf5of7
There's another component that you're overlooking. Does someone who's been working for three years have three years of experience or one year of experience repeated three times?;jkb799e;etdsy;3zrf5of7
You're right that it is somewhat dated.  It really comes from a time when pretty much all CS jobs were full-time jobs and since all jobs were on-site and in-person working 2 full-time CS jobs at the same time was impossible.;jkaksyg;q40ylesy;3zrf5of7
I don't think there's a point to trying to define YoE with that level of precision. It's just a rough metric to gauge the approximate level of skill and independence that a candidate can bring to the table. As with all metrics there are situations where it's misleading.If you want to apply for a job that wants 6 years of experience and you want to claim that your 3 years of working two jobs counts fine. But if you believe that then you better expect that your achievements and interview performance will be compared against people who have a regular 6 years because that is the bar you are claiming you can meet.;jkbz0dl;k2uqykv;3zrf5of7
YOE is so widely used because people in HR have absolutely no idea what they need and who they are hiring.Since they are pretty basic human beings max they can do is to compare numbers. If A is less/more than B.E.g. 5 YOE is less than 8 YOE thus person with 8 YOE is better in doing his/her job than the one with 5 YEO.And s**t goes on because (*)nobody really cares(*) Nobody who's decisive in HR department.;jkc2cfj;7rz5za;3zrf5of7
I know people who were doing simple CRUD apps for 10 years.Do they have 10 YOE? Or they have 1 YOE repeated ten times?;jkc2g3s;7rz5za;b7id4g6
So I didn‚Äôt get into any of the general mega-brand prestige schools this year (ivies Stanford Duke MIT). However I got into several top state schools for CS and am definitely excited for the one I chose. I know for general SWE the school name doesn‚Äôt matter as much but what about for more business-facing CS stuff like product/managerial roles in the future? Is it much harder without a big-time private school brand to get in front of clients and be executive-level down the road?;13if6f7;vewvzgok;
To get in right out of college yes. Breaking in out of college is uncommon and tends to require a prestigious background.Getting in after several years in another role no but you have to look for a company that is willing to let you lateral in.;jk9lfvs;4jp1c6v;vewvzgok
For product management roles at big tech it definitely matters quite a bit:  https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/mbh6bf/university_representation_within_top_apm_rpm/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1But they will recruit from the good state schools as well.;jk9lgm0;w9uii2to;vewvzgok
Doesn‚Äôt matter for 98% of jobs. Matters for a few. Even then it‚Äôs not written in stone.;jk9hxs8;2tu8n7l9;vewvzgok
What state school if you don't mind be asking?;jk9hg56;7efvq4nc;vewvzgok
If you really want to go into management don't worry too much about the undergrad. Get good grades and try to get someone to pay for a prestigious MBA program. PMs right out of college is rare and virtually unheard of in many large tech organizations.;jk9xnb9;1ai6k2h7;vewvzgok
By the time you are potentially looking at executive roles no one cares about your undergrad you went to decades ago.;jkb89mu;3fta2;vewvzgok
So you think it‚Äôs possible but mainly if I wait a few years out of school?;jk9oa0v;vewvzgok;4jp1c6v
Thanks for sharing it‚Äôs very insightful! My school makes the list but it‚Äôs well below the top 5 of Stanford/Berkeley/Harvard/UPenn/Duke on the list. Also my school has a significantly larger student body than all of those schools except Berkeley which makes it seem like even more of an uphill battle. It seems a few people are saying it‚Äôs more doable the more years out of college I get? Seems like your link for APM roles is solely for out of college;jk9otq1;vewvzgok;w9uii2to
That‚Äôs a fair point. I guess I was hoping to keep my options open and see if there‚Äôs any artificial ceiling for me;jk9nxkr;vewvzgok;2tu8n7l9
UMich I know it‚Äôs a great school but I didn‚Äôt apply for Ross which I kind of regret now because I think now doing dual with Ross is going to be very difficult. However if I went for Ross and then tried to dual with CS it would‚Äôve been more doable I believe;jk9o79w;vewvzgok;7efvq4nc
"It's always possible with the right network or luck but yeah the more common route for anyone would be to work at a company as an engineer volunteer for product/bizops work on the side to gain experience and then ask to be laterally transferred into that department.For clarification it's hard to just be a SWE at ""XYZ"" and then apply to PM at ""ABC"". You want to go SWE at XYZ -> PM at XYZ -> PM at ABC.Not all companies are nice about helping you transition from SWE to PM though. SWEs who get stuck usually do MBAs.";jkaoedj;4jp1c6v;vewvzgok
I read below that you're going to UMich. UMich is a top tier CS school and you can recruit for any role you want out of college. The difficulty I described is more applicable to schools like ASU.;jkaomhr;4jp1c6v;vewvzgok
I think that's fine. Umich is very well respected. Also product is normally not entry level in my experience. So what you do in your early jobs probably matters more.;jk9xal2;7efvq4nc;vewvzgok
I‚Äôm coming from JavaScript and think it‚Äôs hell on earth.  Python is a pleasurable walk in the park.  Why can‚Äôt every language be like this AND how can I as self taught get a job coding in it?;13i8x5z;dv5vutgj;

Oh boy I wish I could do more python as well. I'm into embedded and got very used to C language (arguably not the easiest) and now C++ is everywhere. Modern C++ syntax even for a C guru (8YOE) is completely unintuitive.;jk8muti;cjuy32x6;dv5vutgj
IOW you switched from JS to Python in your small personal hobby projects so you have no idea how well either works professionally?;jk8sm2b;ukeubsd5;dv5vutgj
Define ‚Äúself-taught‚Äù in your context.;jk8nbwm;32nu9vwc;dv5vutgj
Python is mostly used for data engineering data  science machine learning deep learning and in devops. All areas that are not junior friendly even for CS majors so realistically not very easy to use professionally as a self taught person.If that makes you feel better this feeling of being really excited by the syntax of a language dies down very quickly after a couple months you probably won‚Äôt care anymore what the language looks like and to be honest large professional Python codebases are kind of a mess to maintain due to the lack of typing and lack of curly braces to clearly mark the beginning or the end of a block of code.But if you like it maybe learn it as a side tool to automate some basic tasks (it‚Äôs really good at that) or to do web scraping for your projects (also very useful). You can also use it as your back end if you develop REST APIs and this way you can showcase your projects using it but in industry it‚Äôs not exactly a market leader in that.;jk9122w;ky31qj69;dv5vutgj
As an experienced C++ embedded dev yes.;jk971rp;40j8xe4u;cjuy32x6

When you saying ‚Äúcoming from JavaScript‚Äù is that from a self-study/hobby context or a professional context?;jk8ovqa;32nu9vwc;dv5vutgj
Not really. Python and Java are quite different in syntax structure and how you program with them. (Interfaces abstract classes access modifiers types and C like syntax + other features).If you want to Segway into java best is to just learn Java and not waste time on other languages. That being said I think as you try to get your first job in the industry it‚Äôs important not to language hop too much. Just pick a language that matches your goals (I mean a language used for the type of job you want to do example: JavaScript for front end Python for data science etc) and stick with it for a while until you feel comfortable building full applications with it. This way you will be job ready quicker. If it helps you I think JavaScript is used a lot all over the industry and is probably the best language for jobs that are more open to juniors / self taught people.;jk94jab;ky31qj69;dv5vutgj
Well you must get invited to all the fun parties‚Ä¶.man.How miserable do you have to be to come shit on people on Reddit for asking a question.

Agreed but the core of what they're saying is true: The sort of stuff a lot of people do when they start programming is *completely divorced* from what we do in the real world to an extent that's sort of hard to explain. We don't actually solve 99% of our own programming problems. Other people have already done that and created libraries / frameworks / etc. to do that for us. The only people who use programming in the way it's thought of from a hobbyist perspective as a day-to-day skill are people who need to do a lot of complex math or need to make some operation happen very quickly. There are very very few people in positions like that. Those who are have CompSci degrees.  Instead what really makes a language convenient or inconvenient is what happens when you need to take a bunch of stuff other people already made and plug it together. Can you stop those different components from relying too heavily on each other? Can you make changes to one chunk of your code without five other people needing to change things as well? Could other people *accidentally* change the functionality of something *you* wrote? Some languages are meant to make problems like that easier to solve. Typically they are object-oriented (like Javascript). The more the language is meant to solve those problems the less convenient it is when you're just hammering something out... but it gets way more convenient from a team-wide stupid-proofing perspective.   More importantly what problems have people already solved in that language? In JavaScript's case it was specifically developed as a language for web browsers so people started building libraries and frameworks n' things to help out with web development. There's really no further logic to it than that. Python meanwhile is in the unique position of being an interpreted language developed for the sole purpose of being simple from a line-by-line perspective. That made it useful for scientists who don't build huge over-complex web apps so much as over-specific calculators. Python is *great* for that.  ...And yet Python has web frameworks n' stuff! Specifically Flask & Django. Which is great for people who love Python. But you won't see them being used super often outside of small projects where you don't need to worry about all those project management problems I just talked about.   **The point is** as a developer you need to learn to not care too much about the language. We all love some and hate others but we've got to work with whatever. It's more realistic to think about what sort of problems you want to deal with and which you *can* deal with. I don't like being the guy plugging frameworks together. I hate that most of my job is finding the magic words to make someone else's ideas work when they did a piss-poor job of documenting things. I hate needing to warp my brain into someone else's mode of thought. That super rewarding act of breaking a problem down and building a little code machine that solves it is gone. BUT I'm not a math-enjoying degree-wielding compsci dude with extra competency in fintech or biology or something. So I'm stuck being the framework web dev dude.;jk8yrgc;taykf;dv5vutgj
I'm sure they invite you instead for your clever wit.I don't need to be miserable at all to do that. How miserable do you have to be to invent stories that others must have been picked on because your pride was wounded by a reddit comment?I help people here all the time and elsewhere. But have fun masturbating to your fantasy that I'm trying to be exclusive here. That's oddly specific like you have some real baggage.;jk9dbnr;ukeubsd5;dv5vutgj
I think your question could be generalized for any programming language then.With no credentials it‚Äôs a tough road but not an impossible one.  Focus on getting some demonstrable portfolio projects together plus get good at Leetcoding.Those are probably your first big steps if you‚Äôre committed to this.;jk9sjla;32nu9vwc;dv5vutgj

HelloWhen Chat GPT first came out I posted on here about what the hype is and how I struggled. Half a year down the line and I still struggle with it. I work at a large insurance company developing CRUD applications. I try using it every once in a while and get no luck. In my opinion it‚Äôs on par with google and stack over flow. Am I using it wrong? I see so many articles on CNBC and Linkedin how software devs will be replaced soon and i don‚Äôt get it. Such a little part of my day is writing the boiler plate code that it can spit out after asking it multiple times.Any other opinions? Thanks Also I have 3 yoe and a mscs. My tech stack is ASP.NET and sql server .;13irge8;2vfv4mp3;
Yes you're taking tech advice from mainstream news that exaggerates everything even on topics they do understand.;jkbc1gb;b7id4g6;2vfv4mp3
If there's any sort of business logic involved in the work you're doing it's not going to work. Like what many have posted before it's good to generate test cases or to generate a generic template that you yourself then have to modify for your particular situation.;jkbjcbb;57xmr3fu;2vfv4mp3
"It can't really code for you. People that say that chatgpt will replace dev probably can't code themselves. It is an amazing tool if you know what you are looking for and what to ask. For instance if you are trying to set up a project using npm that has webpack and typescript you can ask:""Can you give me the commands to install webpack and typescript for my project with some boilerplate code using npm""And if you don't know about something you can ask:""Can you give me some documentation on X library and some examples?""You then use those examples to change your code around it. But copy pasting chatgpt code is a bad idea because most of the time it will have errors. It's really good to come up with somewhat okay code structure overall tho so you can ask:""Can you write a function in js that read from X file and logs the output asynchronously?""And it'll give you the codeSo yeah it's kinda like google where you need to know what you are looking for but it is a time saver when it comes to explaining basics. Just gotta know how to write the questions";jkbjtea;1tt99p8j;2vfv4mp3
"what do you mean ""can‚Äôt **use** chat GPT""  >In my opinion it‚Äôs on par with google and stack over flow.  ? it kind of is? what did you think it is?  >I see so many articles on CNBC and Linkedin how software devs will be replaced soon and i don‚Äôt get it  well it gets people anxious and gets them clicks which translates to $$ imagine you're CNBC wouldn't you do the same? who cares if you're right or wrong?";jkbd49x;11hljx;2vfv4mp3
Next you'll realize that mainstream media doesn't give accurate info about almost anything!;jkbqnlf;ukeubsd5;2vfv4mp3
"I spent 5 years in college. I changed majors worked really hard and put my health on the line to maintain good grades and learn as much as I could manage. I transferred into CS in my last 2 years of college and was playing catchup for those 2 years. What I didn‚Äôt realize then (2020) was how many people claim to go from no development experience to SWE in 4 months 6 months a year. i‚Äôd like to think this doesn‚Äôt really happen but every time I see one of those comments I wonder if CS is really just going to become one of those things where eventually they‚Äôll just hire anyone that can demonstrate some basic coding skills and how that will decrease the value of the job. How many self taught chemical engineers are out there? Electrical engineers? If people can be SWE in 4 months why do they need to make more than electrical engineers who always need a real degree to get hired? I‚Äôm on the verge of pursuing a masters in CS because of timing convenience but i‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs a worthwhile investment at all considering the confusion and uncertainty with SWE jobs moving forward. What are your opinions on the matter? Any other grads out there feel concerned about their choice in degree? Tldr; if they‚Äôre hiring boot campers now will SWE continue to be competitive salary-wise with other stem based engineering careers?";13il2ec;xcev5;
For every story you about somebody who found success with boot camps/self taught how many people do you think didn't have success? On top of that how many of those boot camp grads/self taught individuals actually have a college degree in something else?;jkacctq;328doggt;xcev5
I got a programming job and have a good career now without a college degree specifically in CS. Y'know what I went through between leaving school (when I decided to pivot into programming) and when I landed that first job? Y'know what I went through in the early years of my career? You shouldn't be jealous of people like me. When we brag about it it's because we're proud of being able to beat odds and do a little more in life than just bare survival. Stop comparing yourself to others. A CS degree is absolutely worth it for most people.;jkaefy5;7s9qbgk00;xcev5
Why are you fretting so much about other people's success? If they got a job through a boot camp great. Respect. Who cares?;jkagt31;9hevu8wf4;xcev5
Bro you are paying not only for the knowledge but also for the credentials. Buy them if you can because it will make every step in your career a little bit easier.;jkafk9g;66s7dk94h;xcev5
Why waste mental energy thinking about things in the past I can't change?;jkaf5tf;sqkgkj9w;xcev5
people stress over all sorts of nonsense. i went to a prep school that cost $200k other people went to public high schools and still end up in better colleges or companies than me. should I just sulk everyday because a bunch of good will huntings just griddy into Jane Street? no I enjoy life as it is. i'm having fun. sometimes people really need to take a deep breath and relax.;jkahvaf;ctd81qle;xcev5
"I don't think I have ever seen or interviewed or worked with a boot camp grad meaning they're not even getting past HR filters  >If people can be SWE in 4 months  did you ask what's their TC? because that's the biggest detail   if you tell me a bootcamp grad is making $50k/year TC I'd totally believe that but if you tell me that same person is making $200k/year TC there's definitely something other than just a ""bootcamp grad"" going on ex. perhaps that person already holds a PhD in physics that he didn't tell you or his dad has been the CTO for 20+ years...  for your question though no I don't regret going for CS degree without a CS degree there's no way I'd be where I am today";jkbe1bd;11hljx;xcev5
I started off attending and finishing a bootcamp.Once I got the opportunity while working I finished my BSCS degree. Getting that degree was the best thing I ever did for my career: a ton more calls and a higher salary.Additionally I don't have to answer questions for the next few decades about not having a degree and getting filtered out. No more imposter syndrome getting defensive or wishful thinking. I get put on a team full of people without CS degrees and immediately get regarded at a higher level. Not to mention many high-level positions are available as ceilings are now gone. That's worth it 100%.;jkam5t5;ey8q4;xcev5
Not in the slightest. I learned far more than just coding in uni. And I could code circles around the avg bootcamper when I graduated. Plus I interview bootcampers and I see how much they know during that.;jkard00;ukeubsd5;xcev5
Do you feel that your job is pointless when someone wins a lottery of $500mil? Probably not.;jkaumm6;2af3pho4;xcev5
I think degrees are a game many of us have to play to get the interview.There's still too many companies who won't take a chance on someone unless they have a degree...not unless their resume/portfolio is loaded with experience.;jkaeyvz;fvcls;xcev5
It's been my experience that most of those success stories happened years ago and they got their jobs from family/friends.;jkajq1b;2zcgwz60;xcev5
self taught and bootcamper success is very rare compared to cs grads. Also they typically don't reach the same level as quickly as cs grads and in some cases never do.I was self taught and had to work for low wages at a couple fly by night companies using shitty tech for years while grinding algos and DS on the side to finally get to a good company. The level of job I have now is probably equivalent to what someone could get out of a decent CS program with a solid GPA and a couple good internships. Many here still claim I'm underpaid for my area. I may be slightly underpaid but cannot switch at the moment for personal reasons.;jkbikdx;53bpbucj;xcev5
so true we put an emphasis and the spotlight on people who did bootcamps and got a job but we forget about the people who dropped out.think there goes a saying like ‚Äúwe remember the few that succeeded and forget the many that failed‚Äù;jkc7d2h;buq7nat;328doggt
Wanted to be a software engineer but its looking like that might change throughout the years.;13i7ih8;12rpfi;
"Trade AI-generated NFTs? Court jester to our AI overlords? OnlyFans?On a serious note I don't get the hype at all. I use ChatGPT a lot as part of my software development process. I also use Copilot extensively. Neither of them produces functioning code most of the time with copilot being slightly more accurate than chatGPT thanks to a bit of context-awareness.Just yesterday I asked ChatGPT for a simple 4-field form as a Svelte component and it gave me some hybrid of Svelte and React that wouldn't run under either framework. After I convinced it to modify the code into something that actually ran it still managed to screw up the reactivity of a nested field so badly that the page was just plain unusable without a lot of hand-holding.For a simple form that didn't even *do* anything. And keep in mind even getting that far required knowing what libraries to use how I wanted the code structured what the code was supposed to do how Svelte works in the first place and defining the problem in terms an LLM could understand (which is by no means in natural language).Can it get better? Sure with speciality training it could solve a company's problems/domain. For very large companies (like google) they might have the resources pre-existing code and the inclination to train Bard to make it genuinely useful.But general training has some pretty major limitations and most companies will never have the resources time or skill to do specialized model training. Even for the ones inclined to spend the money training an AI model on your domain may be impossible simply due to the proprietary nature of your domain or limited by the novelty of your product.We're several major breakthroughs away from AI replacing software developers even junior ones. As with all things AI those breakthroughs could come in a year or those breakthroughs could always be ""just ten years away"".*When* AI reaches the point where it can take a business/product owner's description then interpret ask clarifying questions develop test deploy and maintain the code reliably we'll have bigger problems as a species than ""What will programmers do with themselves"". There won't be much white collar work left at that point as we'll be near if not at AGI which is when things get very disruptive very fast.";jk8i832;8qeumqv4;12rpfi
If SWE as a career is screwed because of AI you can reasonably assume that every white collar job will be screwed because of it. So I kind of doubt that changing your career would be a good idea;jk8lalk;do8xl;12rpfi
This is the new ‚Äúwhat language should I learn to be relevant in the coming years.‚Äù;jk90b61;a9x29bs4g;12rpfi
AI engineer. Those AI models need someone to design deploy train and maintain.;jk8fo7l;2jvyhe6o;12rpfi
What's up with all the fear mongering then? Big SE YouTubers saying it may die out...;jk8maom;12rpfi;8qeumqv4
And at that point you‚Äôd have to make a major jump to another field assuming that‚Äôs even an option and society hasn‚Äôt descended into chaos.  My fallback career is Nursing.  Takes like 16-24 months to pivot into after getting a bachelors in another field and if someone can make a robot that can do the job of a Nurse that doesn‚Äôt cost a million dollars or more to build then human labor is on the way out in general.;jk8n53z;1279xa;do8xl
Because it gets clicks? People are addicted to fear.Let's say AI completely replaces SWE one day. What non CS career is safe at that point? What's your fallback plan? How will you compete with the millions of people vying for the few CS jobs you're looking for as an answer to your OP?We'll work alongside AI tools daily in the future but if they've gotten to the point where SWE goes away there's gonna be way bigger things to worry about.;jk8muqi;9hevu8wf4;12rpfi
There‚Äôs some legitimate potential concerns about AI eventually reducing demand for SWEs especially on the junior and new grad end of the spectrum.  However the main issue with a lot of the doom and gloom messaging is that it‚Äôs spread by people with a vested interest in doing so.  For the YouTube example sensational headlines and messaging generate clicks and ad revenue.  For AI companies themselves they‚Äôre trying to get people to adopt and leverage their products.;jk8mxky;1279xa;12rpfi
"Depends on which set of fear mongering you're looking at.Some of it is an optimistic belief in the progress of AI (see subreddits like r/singularity and r/collapse). Some of it is pure hype created by companies attempting to market and sell AI-based products (both the OpenAIs of the world and the many early-adopters building on top of it). Some of it is just the old refrain of ""Robots are going to take our jobs"" that we've been hearing since 1962 when the first robot entered a factory.And to be fair some of it is legitimate concern about how capitalist growth-based societies can hope to deal with AGI which again could come suddenly or not at all. The problem is if we don't make a plan for it we'll surely face a lot of chaos if/when it happens. So there are legitimate fears there.But what's missed by a lot of people on this subreddit is that it doesn't matter if AI takes *our* jobs because if AI can take our jobs then it's taken *every* white collar job. Software engineers marketers and youtubers will be amongst the last to go. If we're gone there's nothing left to pivot to.Programming involves a combination that is almost impossible for AI as it exists today to meet. Specificity accuracy and creativity. It has to be creative *and* correct *and* the problem space it's addressing is unique/specific to the requester. That's something ChatGPT can't do currently. And by the time its successor can it will be able to do any job that doesn't require physical labor.";jk8oe4c;8qeumqv4;12rpfi
"because there's always suckers who will give them money for their actions... I mean if you think about it on a deeper level the entire world is geared around ""how to make you give your money to me""";jk9oil1;11hljx;12rpfi

By the time AI replaces the majority of software engineers it will already have replaced pretty much every other job. At that point we either have AI do everything for us and we just chill or society completely collapse and we‚Äôre all fucked. So why worry about it now;jka95q0;99dh58js;4nct4

It depends on how good you are at your job.But look how much the field has changed in the past 30 years. My guess is that it will change even more in the next 30. Sure there will become more and more that can and should be automated. But it is a skill to know what to ask the computer just like effectively googling is an important skill now.;jkah9pi;79auusmry;4nct4

I mean... even if it's coming... what are we going to do about it? It's kind of like the weather. If it happens it happens - can't control it.If I were in CS I definitely wouldn't rely on just working the same job through to retirement though. I guess best you can do is not get too comfortable and start working on more niche types of work that will be harder for AI to get into. Free ride is over.;jk9vrih;ewfnf3pd;4nct4

"I'm not in denial but I'm not really scared either  if you tell me there's definitely won't be job losses I'd say bullshit  but on the other hand there will likely also be new jobs created jobs that we can't even imagine today think of say milk delivery in like the 1940s or horse carriage driver in the 1800s did those jobs went away? yes but if you tell horse carriage drivers there's job openings for car technicians they might go ""what's a car?""
